This technique has a direct application in immunology and serology. Among other applications it confi  rms the \npresence of antibodies or antigens of an infectious agent in an organism, antibodies from a vaccine or auto-antibodies, for example in rheumatoid arthritis.OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThe microplate reader is a specialized spectrophotometer. Unlike the c onventional spectrophotometer which facilitates \nreadings on a wide range of wavelengths, the microplate reader has filters or diffraction gratings that limit the wavelength range to that used in ELISA, generally between 400 to 750 nm (nanometres). Some readers operate in the ultraviolet range and carry out analyses between 340 to 700 nm. The optical system exploited by many manufacturers uses optic fi  bres to supply light to the microplate wells \ncontaining the samples. The light beam, passing through the sample has a diameter ranging between 1 to 3 mm. A detection system detects the light coming from the sample, amplifi  es the signal and determines the sample’s \nabsorbance. A reading system converts it into data allowing the test result interpretation. Some microplate readers use double beam light systems.\nTest samples are located in specially designed plates with \na specifi  c number of wells where the procedure or test is \ncarried out. Plates of 8 columns by 12 rows with a total of 96 wells are common. There are also plates with a greater number of wells. For specialized applications, the current trend is to increase the number of wells (384-well plates) to reduce the amount of reagents and samples used and a greater throughput. The location of the optical sensors of the microplate reader varies depending on the manufacturers: these can be located above the sample plate, or directly underneath the plate’s wells.\nNowadays microplate readers have controls regulated by \nmicroprocessors; connection interfaces to information systems; quality and process control programs, which by means of a computer, allow complete test automation.Chapter 1\nMicroplate Reader\nGMDN Code 37036\nECRI Code 16-979\nDenomination Photometric micro-plate reader\nPhoto courtesy of BioRad Laboratories ', 'Title: data.pdfMAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n3INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS\nIn order for the microplate reader to operate correctly, the \nfollowing points need to be respected:  \n1. A clean, dust free environment. 2. A stable work table away from equipment that vibrates \n(centrifuges, agitators). It should be of a suitable size so that there is working space at the side of the microplate reader. The required complementary equipment for conducting the technique described above is: washer, incubator, dispenser and computer with its peripheral attachments. \n3. An electrical supply source, which complies with the \ncountry’s norms and standards. In the countries of the Americas for example, 110 V and 60 Hertz frequencies are generally used, whereas other regions of the World use 220-240V, 50/60HZ.\nCalibration of the microplate reader \nThe calibration of a microplate reader is a specialized process which must be ex ecuted by a technician or trained engineer \nfollowing the instructions provided by each manufacturer. In order to do the calibration, it is necessary to have a set of grey fi  lters mounted on a plate of equal geometric size \nto those used in the analyses. Manufacturers provide these calibration plates for any wavelength the equipment uses. \nCalibration plates are equipped with at least three pre-\nestablished optic density values within the measurement ranges; low, medium, and high value. In order to perform the calibration, follow this process:1. Place the calibration plate on the equipment. 2. Carry out a complete reading with the calibration plate. \nVerify if there are diff  erences in the readings obtained \nfrom well to well. If this is the case, invert the plate (180°) and repeat the reading to rule out that diff  erences are \nattributed to the plate itself. In general, it is accepted that the instrument does not need further calibration if the plate results are as expected at two wavelengths. \n3. Verify if the reader requires calibration. If so, proceed \nwith the calibration following the routine outlined by the manufacturer, verifying that the reading’s linearity is maintained as rigorously as possible. \n4. If the instrument does not have a calibration plate, verify \nit by placing a coloured solution in the wells of a plate and immediately carry out a complete reading. Then invert the plate 180° and read the plate again. If both readings display identical, average values in each row, the reader is calibrated. 5. Verify that the reader is calibrated, column by column. \nPlace a clean, empty plate and carry out a reading. If there is no diff  erence between each of the average \nreading of the fi  rst to the last column, it can be assumed \nthat the reader is calibrated.\nROUTINE MAINTENANCE \nMaintenance described next focuses exclusively on the micr oplate reader. The maintenance of the microplate \nwasher is described in Chapter 2.\nBasic maintenance \nFrequency: Daily1. Review that optical sensors of each channel are clean. \nIf dirt is detected, clean the surface of the windows of the light emitters and the sensors with a small brush.\n2. Confi  rm that the lighting system is clean.\n3. Verify that the reader’s calibration is adequate. When \nthe daily operations begin, let the reader warm up for 30 minutes. Next, do a blank reading and then read a full plate of substrate. The readings must be identical. If not, invert the plate and repeat the reading in order to determine if the deviation originated in the plate or the reader.\n4. Examine the automatic drawer sliding system. It must \nbe smooth and constant.\nPreventive maintenance\nFrequency: Quarterly1. Verify the stability of the lamp. Use the calibration plate, \nconducting readings with intervals of 30 minutes with the same plate. Compare readings. There must be no diff erences. \n2.

The plate wells are coated with antibodies or antigens. 2. Samples, controls and standards are added to the wells \nand incubated at temperatures ranging between room temperature and 37 °C for a determined period of time, according to the test’s characteristics. During the incubation, the sample’s antigen binds to the antibody coated to the plate; or the antibody in the sample binds to the antigen coated on the plate, according to their presence and quantity in the sample analyzed.\n3. After incubation, the unbound antigen or antibodies are \nwashed and removed from the plate by the microplate washer using an appropriate washing buff  er.\n4. Next, a secondary antibody, called the conjugate, is \nadded. This harbours an enzyme which will react with a substrate to produce a change of colour at a later step.\n5.

After the incubation, a new washing cycle is done to \nremove unbound conjugate from the wells.\n7.  A substrate is added. The enzyme reacts with the \nsubstrate and causes the solution to change in colour. This will indicate how much antigen-antibody complex is present at the end of the test. \n8. Once the incubation time is completed, a reagent \nis added to stop the enzyme-substrate reaction and to prevent further changes in colour. This reagent is generally a diluted acid. \n9.

2The microplate reader is used for reading the results of ELISA tests. This technique has a direct application in immunology and serology. Among other applications it confi  rms the presence of antibodies or antigens of an infectious agent in an organism, antibodies from a vaccine or auto-antibodies, for example in rheumatoid arthritis.

OPERATION PRINCIPLES
The microplate reader is a specialized spectrophotometer. Unlike the conventional spectrophotometer which facilitates readings on a wide range of wavelengths, the microplate reader has filters or diffraction gratings that limit the wavelength range to that used in ELISA, generally between 400 to 750 nm (nanometres). Some readers operate in the ultraviolet range and carry out analyses between 340 to 700 nm. The optical system exploited by many manufacturers uses optic fi  bres to supply light to the microplate wells 
containing the samples. The light beam, passing through the sample, has a diameter ranging between 1 to 3 mm. A detection system detects the light coming from the sample, amplifies the signal and determines the sample’s absorbance. A reading system converts it into data allowing the test result interpretation. Some microplate readers use double beam light systems.

For specialized applications, the current trend is to increase the number of wells (384-well plates) to reduce the amount of reagents and samples used and a greater throughput. The location of the optical sensors of the microplate reader varies depending on the manufacturers: these can be located above the sample plate, or directly underneath the plate’s wells.

Nowadays microplate readers have controls regulated by

After incubation, the unbound antigen or antibodies are \nwashed and removed from the plate by the microplate washer using an appropriate washing buff  er.\n4. Next, a secondary antibody, called the conjugate, is \nadded. This harbours an enzyme which will react with a substrate to produce a change of colour at a later step.\n5.

The technique \nis based on the detection of an antigen or antibodies captured on a solid surface using direct or secondary, labelled antibodies, producing a reaction whose product can be read by the spectrophotometer. The word ELISA is the acronym for “Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay” . This chapter covers the use of microplate readers for ELISA testing.

This technique has a direct application in immunology and serology.

Unlike the c onventional spectrophotometer which facilitates \nreadings on a wide range of wavelengths, the microplate reader has filters or diffraction gratings that limit the wavelength range to that used in ELISA, generally between 400 to 750 nm (nanometres). Some readers operate in the ultraviolet range and carry out analyses between 340 to 700 nm. The optical system exploited by many manufacturers uses optic fi  bres to supply light to the microplate wells \ncontaining the samples. The light beam, passing through the sample has a diameter ranging between 1 to 3 mm. A detection system detects the light coming from the sample, amplifi  es the signal and determines the sample’s \nabsorbance. A reading system converts it into data allowing the test result interpretation. Some microplate readers use double beam light systems.\nTest samples are located in specially designed plates with \na specifi  c number of wells where the procedure or test is \ncarried out.

The technique \nis based on the detection of an antigen or antibodies captured on a solid surface using direct or secondary, labelled antibodies, producing a reaction whose product can be read by the spectrophotometer. The word ELISA is the acronym for “Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay” . This chapter covers the use of microplate readers for ELISA testing. For additional information on the instrument principles of operation and maintenance, consult Chapter 11 discussing the spectrophotometer.\nPHOTOGRAPH OF MICROPLATE READER\nPURPOSE OF THE MICROPLATE READER\nThe microplate reader is used for reading the results of ELISA \ntests. This technique has a direct application in immunology and serology. Among other applications it confi  rms the \npresence of antibodies or antigens of an infectious agent in an organism, antibodies from a vaccine or auto-antibodies, for example in rheumatoid arthritis.OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThe microplate reader is a specialized spectrophotometer. Unlike the c onventional spectrophotometer which facilitates \nreadings on a wide range of wavelengths, the microplate reader has filters or diffraction gratings that limit the wavelength range to that used in ELISA, generally between 400 to 750 nm (nanometres). Some readers operate in the ultraviolet range and carry out analyses between 340 to 700 nm. The optical system exploited by many manufacturers uses optic fi  bres to supply light to the microplate wells \ncontaining the samples. The light beam, passing through the sample has a diameter ranging between 1 to 3 mm. A detection system detects the light coming from the sample, amplifi  es the signal and determines the sample’s \nabsorbance. A reading system converts it into data allowing the test result interpretation. Some microplate readers use double beam light systems.\nTest samples are located in specially designed plates with \na specifi  c number of wells where the procedure or test is \ncarried out. Plates of 8 columns by 12 rows with a total of 96 wells are common. There are also plates with a greater number of wells. For specialized applications, the current trend is to increase the number of wells (384-well plates) to reduce the amount of reagents and samples used and a greater throughput. The location of the optical sensors of the microplate reader varies depending on the manufacturers: these can be located above the sample plate, or directly underneath the plate’s wells.\nNowadays microplate readers have controls regulated by \nmicroprocessors; connection interfaces to information systems; quality and process control programs, which by means of a computer, allow complete test automation.Chapter 1\nMicroplate Reader\nGMDN Code 37036\nECRI Code 16-979\nDenomination Photometric micro-plate reader\nPhoto courtesy of BioRad Laboratories ']","Routine maintenance for a microplate reader includes verifying the stability of the lamp, cleaning the detectors’ optical systems and lighting systems, cleaning the plate drawer, and verifying the alignment of each well with the light emission and detection systems."

How should you clean the optical sensors of a microplate reader?,"Clean the optical sensors with a small brush, ensuring they are free from dirt or dust.","['Title: data.pdfMAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n3INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS\nIn order for the microplate reader to operate correctly, the \nfollowing points need to be respected:  \n1.

It should be of a suitable size so that there is working space at the side of the microplate reader. The required complementary equipment for conducting the technique described above is: washer, incubator, dispenser and computer with its peripheral attachments. \n3.

In order to do the calibration, it is necessary to have a set of grey fi  lters mounted on a plate of equal geometric size \nto those used in the analyses. Manufacturers provide these calibration plates for any wavelength the equipment uses. \nCalibration plates are equipped with at least three pre-\nestablished optic density values within the measurement ranges; low, medium, and high value. In order to perform the calibration, follow this process:1. Place the calibration plate on the equipment. 2. Carry out a complete reading with the calibration plate. \nVerify if there are diff  erences in the readings obtained \nfrom well to well. If this is the case, invert the plate (180°) and repeat the reading to rule out that diff  erences are \nattributed to the plate itself. In general, it is accepted that the instrument does not need further calibration if the plate results are as expected at two wavelengths. \n3. Verify if the reader requires calibration. If so, proceed \nwith the calibration following the routine outlined by the manufacturer, verifying that the reading’s linearity is maintained as rigorously as possible. \n4. If the instrument does not have a calibration plate, verify \nit by placing a coloured solution in the wells of a plate and immediately carry out a complete reading. Then invert the plate 180° and read the plate again. If both readings display identical, average values in each row, the reader is calibrated. 5. Verify that the reader is calibrated, column by column. \nPlace a clean, empty plate and carry out a reading.

Microplate reader. 2. Microplate washer (Chapter 2). 3. Liquid dispensing system (multi-channel pipettes may \nbe used). \n4. Incubator to incubate the plates. \nFigure 1 illustrates how this equipment is interrelated.\nMechanical phases of the ELISA technique \nUsing the equipment\nWhen an ELISA t est is conducted, it typically follows these \nsteps:  1. A fi  rst washing of the plate may be done using the \nmicroplate washer. \n2. Using a liquid dispenser or the multi-channel pipettes, \nwells are fi  lled with the solution prepared to be used in \nthe test. \n3. The plate is placed in the incubator where at a controlled \ntemperature, a series of reactions take place. \nStages 1, 2 and 3 can be repeated several times depending \non the test, until the reagents added have completed their reactions.\nFinally, when all the incubation steps have been completed, \nthe plate is transferred to the microplate reader. The reading of the plate is done and a diagnosis can be deduced.Biochemical phases of the ELISA technique1\nThe ELISA technique from a biochemical point of view:1. The plate wells are coated with antibodies or antigens. 2. Samples, controls and standards are added to the wells \nand incubated at temperatures ranging between room temperature and 37 °C for a determined period of time, according to the test’s characteristics. During the incubation, the sample’s antigen binds to the antibody coated to the plate; or the antibody in the sample binds to the antigen coated on the plate, according to their presence and quantity in the sample analyzed.\n3. After incubation, the unbound antigen or antibodies are \nwashed and removed from the plate by the microplate washer using an appropriate washing buff  er.\n4. Next, a secondary antibody, called the conjugate, is \nadded. This harbours an enzyme which will react with a substrate to produce a change of colour at a later step.\n5. Then begins a second period of incubation during \nwhich this conjugate will bind to the antigen-antibody complex in the wells.\n6. After the incubation, a new washing cycle is done to \nremove unbound conjugate from the wells.\n7.  A substrate is added. The enzyme reacts with the \nsubstrate and causes the solution to change in colour. This will indicate how much antigen-antibody complex is present at the end of the test. \n8. Once the incubation time is completed, a reagent \nis added to stop the enzyme-substrate reaction and to prevent further changes in colour. This reagent is generally a diluted acid. \n9. Finally, the plate in is read by the microplate. The \nresulting values are used to determine the specific amounts or the presence of antigens or antibodies in the sample. \nNote:  Some of the wells are used for \nstandards and controls. Standards allow the cut-off   points to be defi  ned. The \nstandards and controls are of known quantities and are used for measuring the success of the test, evaluating data against known concentrations for each control. The process described above is common, although there are many ELISA tests with test-specifi  c variants.\n1 More detailed explanations must be consulted in \nspecialized literature.\n  \n \n Dispensing\nSystemELISA Plate \nWasher\nIncubator\nELISA\nReader\nComputerFigure 1.

What is the function of the microplate washer in the ELISA test?,The microplate washer cleans the wells of ELISA plates by supplying washing buffers and removing unbound reagents during the test stages.,"['Title: data.pdfMAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n7Chapter 2\nMicroplate Washer\nThe microplate washer or “plate or ELISA washer” is designed to \nperform washing operations required in the ELISA technique. The microplate washer performs the washing of the ELISA plate’s wells during the diff  erent stages of the technique.\nPHOTOGRAPH OF MICROPLATE WASHER \nPURPOSE OF THE MICROPLATE WASHER \nThe microplate washer has been designed to supply cleaning \nbuff ers required for the ELISA technique in a controlled \nmanner. In the same fashion, the equipment removes from each well, substances in excess from the reaction. Depending on the test performed, the washer can intervene from one to four times, supplying the washing buff  er, agitating and \nremoving the unbound reagents\n1 until the programmed \ntimes and cycles are completed. The washer has of two reservoirs; one for the washing buff  er, the other for the waste \ngenerated during the washing process.OPERATION PRINCIPLES \nThe microplate washer has been designed to perform washing operations in the ELISA t echnique. The equipment \npossesses at least, the following subsystems which vary depending on the manufacturer’s design. \n•• Control subsystem.  Generally , the washer is controlled \nby microprocessors allowing programming and controlling steps to be performed by the washer such as: number of washing cycles\n2 (1–5); expected times; \nsupplying and extracting pressures; plate format (96–384 wells); suction function adjustment according to the type of well\n3 (fl at bottom, V bottom or rounded \nbottom or strips used); volumes distributed or aspirated; the soaking and agitation cycles, etc.\n•• Supply subsystem.  In general, this comprises a reservoir \nfor the washing solution; one or several pumps; usually a positive displacement type syringe and a dispenser head that supplies the washing solution to the diff  erent \nwells by means of needles. The head usually comes with eight pairs of needles for washing and aspirating simultaneously the wells of the same row (the supply and extraction sub-systems converge on the head). There are models with twelve pairs of needles and others that conduct the washing process simultaneously in all the wells. Some washers off  er the possibility of working \nwith diff  erent types of washing solutions, performing \nthe solution changes according to the program entered by the operator.\n1 See a brief explication of the ELISA technique in Chapter 1, Microplate \nReader . \n2 The exact number of washing operations required depends on the assay \nused. This is explained in each manufacturer’s test instruction manual.\n3 If the bottom is fl  at, the suction needle is located very close to one of well’s \nfaces; if it is rounded or V-shaped, the suction needle is centered. \nGMDN Code 17489\nECRI Code 17-489\nDenomination Micro-plate washer\nPhoto courtesy of BioRad Laboratories ', 'Title: data.pdfCHAPTER 1  MICROPLATE READER\n2Equipment required for ELISA testing\nIn order to perform the ELISA technique, the following \nequipment is r equired:  \n1.

The plate is placed in the incubator where at a controlled \ntemperature, a series of reactions take place. \nStages 1, 2 and 3 can be repeated several times depending \non the test, until the reagents added have completed their reactions.\nFinally, when all the incubation steps have been completed, \nthe plate is transferred to the microplate reader. The reading of the plate is done and a diagnosis can be deduced.Biochemical phases of the ELISA technique1\nThe ELISA technique from a biochemical point of view:1. The plate wells are coated with antibodies or antigens. 2. Samples, controls and standards are added to the wells \nand incubated at temperatures ranging between room temperature and 37 °C for a determined period of time, according to the test’s characteristics. During the incubation, the sample’s antigen binds to the antibody coated to the plate; or the antibody in the sample binds to the antigen coated on the plate, according to their presence and quantity in the sample analyzed.\n3. After incubation, the unbound antigen or antibodies are \nwashed and removed from the plate by the microplate washer using an appropriate washing buff  er.\n4. Next, a secondary antibody, called the conjugate, is \nadded. This harbours an enzyme which will react with a substrate to produce a change of colour at a later step.\n5. Then begins a second period of incubation during \nwhich this conjugate will bind to the antigen-antibody complex in the wells.\n6. After the incubation, a new washing cycle is done to \nremove unbound conjugate from the wells.\n7.  A substrate is added. The enzyme reacts with the \nsubstrate and causes the solution to change in colour. This will indicate how much antigen-antibody complex is present at the end of the test. \n8. Once the incubation time is completed, a reagent \nis added to stop the enzyme-substrate reaction and to prevent further changes in colour. This reagent is generally a diluted acid. \n9. Finally, the plate in is read by the microplate. The \nresulting values are used to determine the specific amounts or the presence of antigens or antibodies in the sample. \nNote:  Some of the wells are used for \nstandards and controls. Standards allow the cut-off   points to be defi  ned. The \nstandards and controls are of known quantities and are used for measuring the success of the test, evaluating data against known concentrations for each control. The process described above is common, although there are many ELISA tests with test-specifi  c variants.\n1 More detailed explanations must be consulted in \nspecialized literature.\n  \n \n Dispensing\nSystemELISA Plate \nWasher\nIncubator\nELISA\nReader\nComputerFigure 1.

The microplate washer performs the washing of the ELISA plate’s wells during the diff  erent stages of the technique.\nPHOTOGRAPH OF MICROPLATE WASHER \nPURPOSE OF THE MICROPLATE WASHER \nThe microplate washer has been designed to supply cleaning \nbuff ers required for the ELISA technique in a controlled \nmanner. In the same fashion, the equipment removes from each well, substances in excess from the reaction. Depending on the test performed, the washer can intervene from one to four times, supplying the washing buff  er, agitating and \nremoving the unbound reagents\n1 until the programmed \ntimes and cycles are completed. The washer has of two reservoirs; one for the washing buff  er, the other for the waste \ngenerated during the washing process.OPERATION PRINCIPLES \nThe microplate washer has been designed to perform washing operations in the ELISA t echnique. The equipment \npossesses at least, the following subsystems which vary depending on the manufacturer’s design. \n•• Control subsystem.  Generally , the washer is controlled \nby microprocessors allowing programming and controlling steps to be performed by the washer such as: number of washing cycles\n2 (1–5); expected times; \nsupplying and extracting pressures; plate format (96–384 wells); suction function adjustment according to the type of well\n3 (fl at bottom, V bottom or rounded \nbottom or strips used); volumes distributed or aspirated; the soaking and agitation cycles, etc.\n•• Supply subsystem.  In general, this comprises a reservoir \nfor the washing solution; one or several pumps; usually a positive displacement type syringe and a dispenser head that supplies the washing solution to the diff  erent \nwells by means of needles. The head usually comes with eight pairs of needles for washing and aspirating simultaneously the wells of the same row (the supply and extraction sub-systems converge on the head). There are models with twelve pairs of needles and others that conduct the washing process simultaneously in all the wells. Some washers off  er the possibility of working \nwith diff  erent types of washing solutions, performing \nthe solution changes according to the program entered by the operator.\n1 See a brief explication of the ELISA technique in Chapter 1, Microplate \nReader . \n2 The exact number of washing operations required depends on the assay \nused. This is explained in each manufacturer’s test instruction manual.\n3 If the bottom is fl  at, the suction needle is located very close to one of well’s \nfaces; if it is rounded or V-shaped, the suction needle is centered. \nGMDN Code 17489\nECRI Code 17-489\nDenomination Micro-plate washer\nPhoto courtesy of BioRad Laboratories ', 'Title: data.pdfCHAPTER 2  MICROPLATE WASHER\n8•• Extraction or suction system.  This requires a vacuum \nmechanism and a storage system for gathering the fl  uids \nand waste removed from the wells. The vacuum may be supplied by external and internal pumps. Extraction is done by a set of needles mounted on the washer/dryer’s head. The number of needles varies from one to three, according to the washer model used.\n  If it uses only one needle, the washing and \nextraction operation is done with this single needle. If it uses two needles, one is used for supplying the washing solution and the other for extraction. If it uses three needles, the fi  rst is used for supplying the washing \nsolution, the second for extraction and the third for controlling (extracting) any excess volume in the well. Generally, the extraction needle is longer than the supply needle, which enables it to advance (vertically) up to a height ranging between 0.3 and 0.5 mm from the bottom of the well.\n•• Advance sub-system.  This is composed of a \nmechanism which moves the supply and extraction head horizontally to reach each well in the ELISA plate. When the horizontal movement to the following row occurs, there is a vertical movement towards the well to dispense or extract the washing solution. There are washers which carry out these operations in a simultaneous manner.The sub-systems previously described are shown in Figure \n2. Figure 3 shows the diff  erent types of wells most commonly \nfound in microplates. Each kind of well is suitable for a particular type of test.\nWashing process\nThe washing of the microplate is one of the stages of the ELISA t echnique. Special solutions are used in the washing \nsteps. Among those most commonly used is phosphate buff er solution or PBS. The phosphate buff  er solution has a \nstability of 2 months if kept at 4 °C. It is estimated that 1 to 3 litres of solution is required for washing one microplate and that 300 µl is used in each well per cycle. Washing can \nbe done manually, but it is preferable to use an automated microplate washer for a better throughput and to minimize handling of potentially contaminated substances.\nAmong the washing processes used by microplate washers \nare featured:\n•• Aspir ation from top to bottom.  When the aspiration \nphase is initiated, the needles move vertically and the aspiration is initiated immediately as these enter into the liquid. The process continues until the needles reach their lowest position very close to the bottom of the wells. At this point they are stopped in order to avoid suctioning the air that should fl  ow against the \ninterior lateral walls of the wells. This type of aspiration prevents air currents from drying the bound protein on the surface of the wells.\nWaste ReceptacleExtraction Pump\nSupply and\nExtraction Head\nHorizontal and \nVertical Displacement\nWells\nELISA PlateWashing \nSolutionSupply PumpsPositive Displacement PumpsFigure 2.  Microplate washer\nFlat \nBottomRound\nBottomV-shaped\nBottomEasy\nWashFigure 3.  Well proﬁ  les ', 'Title: data.pdfMAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n9•• Simultaneous distribution and aspiration.  In certain \ntypes of washer, the washing and aspiration systems operate simultaneously, generating a controlled turbulence inside the well which removes the unbound substances during the incubations.\n•• Aspir ation from the base of the wells.  In this system, \nthe aspiration of the fluid contained in the wells is performed initially with the aspiration needles in a position very close to the bottom, immediately beginning a suctioning cycle, usually time-controlled. This system may aspirate air if there are diff  erences in \nthe levels of the tanks. \nWasher calibration\nThe microplate washer is critical for guaranteeing that the ELISA t echnique performs as expected. The alignment to \nbe taken into account for the eff  ective functioning of the \nequipment is presented next:\n•• Position of the needles (supply and aspiration head).  \nThe horizontal and vertical position adjustment with respect to the wells must be verifi  ed carefully. If the \nplate has fl  at bottom wells, the supply needle must be \nchecked to see that it is situated very close to the well’s wall. If the bottom is round or V-shaped, the suction needle should be located in the centre of the well: upon the vertical movement, a needle-base distance is maintained in the well, usually between 0.3 to 0.5 mm. The needles must never be allowed to touch the bottom of the wells to avoid mechanical interferences between the needle point and the well’s base during the aspiration function.\n•• Aspir ation time.  Appropriately adjust the aspiration \ntime so that a solution fi  lm adhered to the well’s wall \ncan fl  ow towards the bottom. Avoid very long time lapses to prevent the coating on the wells from drying up. Check that the suction system’s needles are clean (free of obstructions). \n•• Distributed V olume.  Check that the volume distributed \nis as close as possible to the maximum capacity of the well; confi  rm that all the wells are fi  lled uniformly (at \nthe same level). Verify that the distributing needles are clean (free of obstructions).\n•• Vacuum.  The suctioning system must be calibrated \neffi  ciently. If the vacuum is too strong, the test can \nbe altered. In fact, it could dry out the wells and considerably weaken the enzyme activity in the wells and completely alter the test result. The majority of washers function with a vacuum ranging between 60 and 70% of atmospheric pressure. In some washers, the vacuum is made in an external pump which operates as an accessory of the washer. Its operation is controlled by the washer, which means that the vacuum pump operates only when required. Washing process veriﬁ  cation \nTo verify that the washing process is done according to \nthe specifications of ELISA t echniques, manufacturers \nof ELISA tests have developed procedures to be carried out regularly. One of the controls\n1 is based on using the \nperoxidase reagent, which is dispensed using a pipette in the plate wells to be read at 405, 450 and 492 nm. At once the wells are washed and a colourless substrate is added (TMB/H\n2O2–Tetramethylbenzidine/Hydrogen Peroxide). \nWhatever conjugate remains will hydrolyze the enzyme and the chromogen will change to blue. After stopping the reaction with acid, the TMB will turn yellow again. The resulting colour intensity is directly related to the washing process effi   ciency.\nINSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS\nFor the microplate washer to operate correctly, the following \nis nec essary: \n1. A clean, dust-free environment. 2. A stable work table located away from equipment \nthat generates vibrations, (centrifuges, and agitators). It must be of a suitable size to locate the necessary complementary equipment: reader, incubator, distributor and computer with its peripheral attachments at the side of the microplate washer.\n3.\n An electric outlet in good condition with a ground pole \nand, an electrical connection which complies with the \ncountry’s or the laboratory’s norms and standards. In the \ncountries of the Americas, the 110 V and 60 Hz frequency \nis generally used. In other parts of the World, the 220-240 \nV and 50/60 Hz frequency is generally used.\nROUTINE MAINTENANCE \nThe routine maintenance described next focuses exclusively on the micr oplate washer. Maintenance of the microplate \nreader is dealt with in the Chapter 1. \nBasic maintenance \nFrequency: Daily 1. Verify the volume distributed. \n2. Test the fi  lling uniformity.\n3. Verify the aspiration sub-system’s effi   ciency.\n4. Confirm the cleaning of the supply and']","To describe the operation principles of a microplate washer, I will follow these steps:

1. Identify the key components of the microplate washer as mentioned in the context.
2. Summarize the functions of each component and how they contribute to the washing process.
3. Highlight the importance of proper alignment and calibration for effective operation.

From the context, the microplate washer has several components that are crucial for its operation:

- **Supply and Extraction Head**: This component is responsible for distributing the washing solution and aspirating waste from the wells. It moves horizontally and vertically to reach each well in the ELISA plate.
- **Aspiration System**: This system suctions the fluid from the wells, starting from the top and moving towards the bottom. It is designed to avoid suctioning air and to prevent drying of the wells.
- **Advanced Distribution and Aspiration**: Some washers use simultaneous distribution and aspiration, generating controlled turbulence to remove unbound substances effectively.
- **Calibration**: Proper calibration of the washer is essential for ensuring that the wells are filled and aspirated correctly. This includes adjusting the position of the needles, the aspiration time, and the vacuum level.

Now, I will compile this information into a succinct summary.

This system may aspirate air if there are diff  erences in \nthe levels of the tanks. \nWasher calibration\nThe microplate washer is critical for guaranteeing that the ELISA t echnique performs as expected. The alignment to \nbe taken into account for the eff  ective functioning of the \nequipment is presented next:\n•• Position of the needles (supply and aspiration head).  \nThe horizontal and vertical position adjustment with respect to the wells must be verifi  ed carefully. If the \nplate has fl  at bottom wells, the supply needle must be \nchecked to see that it is situated very close to the well’s wall. If the bottom is round or V-shaped, the suction needle should be located in the centre of the well: upon the vertical movement, a needle-base distance is maintained in the well, usually between 0.3 to 0.5 mm. The needles must never be allowed to touch the bottom of the wells to avoid mechanical interferences between the needle point and the well’s base during the aspiration function.\n•• Aspir ation time.  Appropriately adjust the aspiration \ntime so that a solution fi  lm adhered to the well’s wall \ncan fl  ow towards the bottom. Avoid very long time lapses to prevent the coating on the wells from drying up. Check that the suction system’s needles are clean (free of obstructions). \n•• Distributed V olume.  Check that the volume distributed \nis as close as possible to the maximum capacity of the well; confi  rm that all the wells are fi  lled uniformly (at \nthe same level). Verify that the distributing needles are clean (free of obstructions).\n•• Vacuum.  The suctioning system must be calibrated \neffi  ciently. If the vacuum is too strong, the test can \nbe altered. In fact, it could dry out the wells and considerably weaken the enzyme activity in the wells and completely alter the test result. The majority of washers function with a vacuum ranging between 60 and 70% of atmospheric pressure. In some washers, the vacuum is made in an external pump which operates as an accessory of the washer. Its operation is controlled by the washer, which means that the vacuum pump operates only when required. Washing process veriﬁ  cation \nTo verify that the washing process is done according to \nthe specifications of ELISA t echniques, manufacturers \nof ELISA tests have developed procedures to be carried out regularly. One of the controls\n1 is based on using the \nperoxidase reagent, which is dispensed using a pipette in the plate wells to be read at 405, 450 and 492 nm. At once the wells are washed and a colourless substrate is added (TMB/H\n2O2–Tetramethylbenzidine/Hydrogen Peroxide). \nWhatever conjugate remains will hydrolyze the enzyme and the chromogen will change to blue. After stopping the reaction with acid, the TMB will turn yellow again. The resulting colour intensity is directly related to the washing process effi   ciency.\nINSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS\nFor the microplate washer to operate correctly, the following \nis nec essary: \n1. A clean, dust-free environment. 2. A stable work table located away from equipment \nthat generates vibrations, (centrifuges, and agitators). It must be of a suitable size to locate the necessary complementary equipment: reader, incubator, distributor and computer with its peripheral attachments at the side of the microplate washer.\n3.\n An electric outlet in good condition with a ground pole \nand, an electrical connection which complies with the \ncountry’s or the laboratory’s norms and standards.

What could cause residual liquid to remain in the wells after washing?,"Possible causes include a malfunctioning vacuum system, blocked suction lines, misaligned needles, or using a different microplate than recommended.","['Title: data.pdfCHAPTER 2  MICROPLATE WASHER\n8•• Extraction or suction system.  This requires a vacuum \nmechanism and a storage system for gathering the fl  uids \nand waste removed from the wells. The vacuum may be supplied by external and internal pumps. Extraction is done by a set of needles mounted on the washer/dryer’s head. The number of needles varies from one to three, according to the washer model used.\n  If it uses only one needle, the washing and \nextraction operation is done with this single needle. If it uses two needles, one is used for supplying the washing solution and the other for extraction. If it uses three needles, the fi  rst is used for supplying the washing \nsolution, the second for extraction and the third for controlling (extracting) any excess volume in the well. Generally, the extraction needle is longer than the supply needle, which enables it to advance (vertically) up to a height ranging between 0.3 and 0.5 mm from the bottom of the well.\n•• Advance sub-system.  This is composed of a \nmechanism which moves the supply and extraction head horizontally to reach each well in the ELISA plate. When the horizontal movement to the following row occurs, there is a vertical movement towards the well to dispense or extract the washing solution. There are washers which carry out these operations in a simultaneous manner.The sub-systems previously described are shown in Figure \n2. Figure 3 shows the diff  erent types of wells most commonly \nfound in microplates. Each kind of well is suitable for a particular type of test.\nWashing process\nThe washing of the microplate is one of the stages of the ELISA t echnique. Special solutions are used in the washing \nsteps. Among those most commonly used is phosphate buff er solution or PBS. The phosphate buff  er solution has a \nstability of 2 months if kept at 4 °C. It is estimated that 1 to 3 litres of solution is required for washing one microplate and that 300 µl is used in each well per cycle. Washing can \nbe done manually, but it is preferable to use an automated microplate washer for a better throughput and to minimize handling of potentially contaminated substances.\nAmong the washing processes used by microplate washers \nare featured:\n•• Aspir ation from top to bottom.  When the aspiration \nphase is initiated, the needles move vertically and the aspiration is initiated immediately as these enter into the liquid. The process continues until the needles reach their lowest position very close to the bottom of the wells. At this point they are stopped in order to avoid suctioning the air that should fl  ow against the \ninterior lateral walls of the wells.

The microplate washer performs the washing of the ELISA plate’s wells during the diff  erent stages of the technique.\nPHOTOGRAPH OF MICROPLATE WASHER \nPURPOSE OF THE MICROPLATE WASHER \nThe microplate washer has been designed to supply cleaning \nbuff ers required for the ELISA technique in a controlled \nmanner. In the same fashion, the equipment removes from each well, substances in excess from the reaction. Depending on the test performed, the washer can intervene from one to four times, supplying the washing buff  er, agitating and \nremoving the unbound reagents\n1 until the programmed \ntimes and cycles are completed. The washer has of two reservoirs; one for the washing buff  er, the other for the waste \ngenerated during the washing process.OPERATION PRINCIPLES \nThe microplate washer has been designed to perform washing operations in the ELISA t echnique. The equipment \npossesses at least, the following subsystems which vary depending on the manufacturer’s design. \n•• Control subsystem.  Generally , the washer is controlled \nby microprocessors allowing programming and controlling steps to be performed by the washer such as: number of washing cycles\n2 (1–5); expected times; \nsupplying and extracting pressures; plate format (96–384 wells); suction function adjustment according to the type of well\n3 (fl at bottom, V bottom or rounded \nbottom or strips used); volumes distributed or aspirated; the soaking and agitation cycles, etc.\n•• Supply subsystem.  In general, this comprises a reservoir \nfor the washing solution; one or several pumps; usually a positive displacement type syringe and a dispenser head that supplies the washing solution to the diff  erent \nwells by means of needles. The head usually comes with eight pairs of needles for washing and aspirating simultaneously the wells of the same row (the supply and extraction sub-systems converge on the head). There are models with twelve pairs of needles and others that conduct the washing process simultaneously in all the wells. Some washers off  er the possibility of working \nwith diff  erent types of washing solutions, performing \nthe solution changes according to the program entered by the operator.\n1 See a brief explication of the ELISA technique in Chapter 1, Microplate \nReader . \n2 The exact number of washing operations required depends on the assay \nused. This is explained in each manufacturer’s test instruction manual.\n3 If the bottom is fl  at, the suction needle is located very close to one of well’s \nfaces; if it is rounded or V-shaped, the suction needle is centered. \nGMDN Code 17489\nECRI Code 17-489\nDenomination Micro-plate washer\nPhoto courtesy of BioRad Laboratories ', 'Title: data.pdfMAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n3INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS\nIn order for the microplate reader to operate correctly, the \nfollowing points need to be respected:  \n1. A clean, dust free environment. 2. A stable work table away from equipment that vibrates \n(centrifuges, agitators). It should be of a suitable size so that there is working space at the side of the microplate reader. The required complementary equipment for conducting the technique described above is: washer, incubator, dispenser and computer with its peripheral attachments. \n3. An electrical supply source, which complies with the \ncountry’s norms and standards. In the countries of the Americas for example, 110 V and 60 Hertz frequencies are generally used, whereas other regions of the World use 220-240V, 50/60HZ.\nCalibration of the microplate reader \nThe calibration of a microplate reader is a specialized process which must be ex ecuted by a technician or trained engineer \nfollowing the instructions provided by each manufacturer. In order to do the calibration, it is necessary to have a set of grey fi  lters mounted on a plate of equal geometric size \nto those used in the analyses. Manufacturers provide these calibration plates for any wavelength the equipment uses. \nCalibration plates are equipped with at least three pre-\nestablished optic density values within the measurement ranges; low, medium, and high value. In order to perform the calibration, follow this process:1. Place the calibration plate on the equipment. 2. Carry out a complete reading with the calibration plate. \nVerify if there are diff  erences in the readings obtained \nfrom well to well. If this is the case, invert the plate (180°) and repeat the reading to rule out that diff  erences are \nattributed to the plate itself. In general, it is accepted that the instrument does not need further calibration if the plate results are as expected at two wavelengths. \n3. Verify if the reader requires calibration. If so, proceed \nwith the calibration following the routine outlined by the manufacturer, verifying that the reading’s linearity is maintained as rigorously as possible. \n4. If the instrument does not have a calibration plate, verify \nit by placing a coloured solution in the wells of a plate and immediately carry out a complete reading. Then invert the plate 180° and read the plate again. If both readings display identical, average values in each row, the reader is calibrated. 5. Verify that the reader is calibrated, column by column. \nPlace a clean, empty plate and carry out a reading. If there is no diff  erence between each of the average \nreading of the fi  rst to the last column, it can be assumed \nthat the reader is calibrated.\nROUTINE MAINTENANCE \nMaintenance described next focuses exclusively on the micr oplate reader. The maintenance of the microplate \nwasher is described in Chapter 2.\nBasic maintenance \nFrequency: Daily1. Review that optical sensors of each channel are clean. \nIf dirt is detected, clean the surface of the windows of the light emitters and the sensors with a small brush.\n2. Confi  rm that the lighting system is clean.\n3. Verify that the reader’s calibration is adequate. When \nthe daily operations begin, let the reader warm up for 30 minutes. Next, do a blank reading and then read a full plate of substrate. The readings must be identical. If not, invert the plate and repeat the reading in order to determine if the deviation originated in the plate or the reader.\n4. Examine the automatic drawer sliding system. It must \nbe smooth and constant.\nPreventive maintenance\nFrequency: Quarterly1. Verify the stability of the lamp. Use the calibration plate, \nconducting readings with intervals of 30 minutes with the same plate. Compare readings. There must be no diff erences. \n2. Clean the detectors’ optical systems and the lighting \nsystems. \n3. Clean the plate drawer. 4. Verify the alignment of each well with the light emission \nand detection systems.', 'Title: data.pdfCHAPTER 2  MICROPLATE WASHER\n10Preventive maintenance \nFrequency: Quarterly\n1.

It is used in areas such as agriculture, water treatment and purifi  cation, in industrial \nprocesses such as petrochemicals, paper manufacture, foods, pharmaceuticals, research and development, metal mechanics, etc. In the health laboratory, its applications are related to the control of culture mediums and to the measurement of the alkalinity or acidity of broths and buff ers. In specialized laboratories, diagnostic equipment \nmicroelectrodes are used to measure the pH of liquid blood components. The plasma pH allows the patient’s health to be evaluated. It normally measures between 7.35 and 7.45. This value relates to the patient’s metabolism in which a multitude of reactions occurs where acids and bases are normally kept in balance. Acids constantly liberate hydrogen ions [H\n+] and the organism neutralizes or balances \nacidity by liberating bicarbonate ions [HCO3–]. The acid-base \nratio in the organism is maintained by the kidneys, (organs in which any excesses present are eliminated).

The tip of the reference electrode’s cathode is inside the body of the probe. On the outside and end of the inner tube is the anodized end. The reference electrode is usually made of the same type of material as the internal electrode. Both tubes, interior and exterior, contain a reference solution. Only the outer tube has contact with the measured solution through a porous cap which acts as a saline bridge.\nThis device acts like a galvanized cell. The reference electrode \nis the internal tube of the pH meter probe, which cannot lose ions through interactions with the surrounding environment. Therefore as a reference, it remains static (unchangeable) during the measuring process. The external tube of the probe contains the medium which is allowed  to mix with the external environment. As a result, this tube must be fi lled periodically with a potassium chloride solution (KCI) \nfor restoring the capacity of the electrode which would otherwise be inhibited by a loss of ions and evaporation. \nThe glass bulb on the lower part of the pH electrode acts \nas a measuring element and is covered with a layer of hydrated gel on its exterior and interior. Metallic sodium cations [Na\n+] are diff  used in the hydrated gel outside of \nthe glass and in the solution, while the hydrogen ions [H+] \nare diff  used in the gel. This gel makes the pH electrode \nion-selective:  Hydrogen ions [H+] cannot pass through the \nglass membrane of the pH electrode. Sodium ions [Na+] pass \nthrough and cause a change in free energy, which the pH meter measures. A brief explanation of the theory on how electrodes function is included in the appendix at the end of the chapter.pH METER COMPONENTS \nA pH meter generally has the following components: 1. The body of the instrument containing the circuits, \ncontrols, connectors, display screens and measuring scales.  The following are among some of its most \nimportant components:\na) An ON and OFF switch.  Not all pH meters have an \non and off   switch. Some simply have a cord with a \nplug which allows it to be connected to a suitable electrical outlet.\nb) Temperature control.

The tip of the reference electrode’s cathode is inside the body of the probe. On the outside and end of the inner tube is the anodized end. The reference electrode is usually made of the same type of material as the internal electrode. Both tubes, interior and exterior, contain a reference solution. Only the outer tube has contact with the measured solution through a porous cap which acts as a saline bridge.\nThis device acts like a galvanized cell. The reference electrode \nis the internal tube of the pH meter probe, which cannot lose ions through interactions with the surrounding environment. Therefore as a reference, it remains static (unchangeable) during the measuring process. The external tube of the probe contains the medium which is allowed  to mix with the external environment. As a result, this tube must be fi lled periodically with a potassium chloride solution (KCI) \nfor restoring the capacity of the electrode which would otherwise be inhibited by a loss of ions and evaporation. \nThe glass bulb on the lower part of the pH electrode acts \nas a measuring element and is covered with a layer of hydrated gel on its exterior and interior. Metallic sodium cations [Na\n+] are diff  used in the hydrated gel outside of \nthe glass and in the solution, while the hydrogen ions [H+] \nare diff  used in the gel. This gel makes the pH electrode \nion-selective:  Hydrogen ions [H+] cannot pass through the \nglass membrane of the pH electrode. Sodium ions [Na+] pass \nthrough and cause a change in free energy, which the pH meter measures. A brief explanation of the theory on how electrodes function is included in the appendix at the end of the chapter.pH METER COMPONENTS \nA pH meter generally has the following components: 1. The body of the instrument containing the circuits, \ncontrols, connectors, display screens and measuring scales.  The following are among some of its most \nimportant components:\na) An ON and OFF switch.  Not all pH meters have an \non and off   switch.

This equipment, provided \nit is carefully used and calibrated, measures the acidity of an aqueous solution. pH meters are sometimes called pH analysers, pH monitors or potentiometers. \nPURPOSE OF THE EQUIPMENT\nThe pH meter is commonly used in any fi  eld of science \nrelated to aqueous solutions. It is used in areas such as agriculture, water treatment and purifi  cation, in industrial \nprocesses such as petrochemicals, paper manufacture, foods, pharmaceuticals, research and development, metal mechanics, etc. In the health laboratory, its applications are related to the control of culture mediums and to the measurement of the alkalinity or acidity of broths and buff ers. In specialized laboratories, diagnostic equipment \nmicroelectrodes are used to measure the pH of liquid blood components. The plasma pH allows the patient’s health to be evaluated. It normally measures between 7.35 and 7.45. This value relates to the patient’s metabolism in which a multitude of reactions occurs where acids and bases are normally kept in balance. Acids constantly liberate hydrogen ions [H\n+] and the organism neutralizes or balances \nacidity by liberating bicarbonate ions [HCO3–]. The acid-base \nratio in the organism is maintained by the kidneys, (organs in which any excesses present are eliminated). The plasma pH is one of the characteristics that vary with factors such as age or state of health of the patient. Table 1 shows typical pH values of some bodily fl  uids.PHOTOGRAPH AND COMPONENTS OF THE \npH METER\nOPERA TION PRINCIPLES\nThe pH meter measures the concentration of hydrogen ions \n[H+] using an ion-sensitive electrode. Under ideal conditions, \nthis electrode should respond in the presence of only one type of ion. In reality, there are always interactions or interferences with other types of ions present in the solution. A pH electrode is generally a combined electrode, in which a reference electrode and an internal glass electrode are integrated into a combined probe. The lower part of the probe ends in a round bulb of thin glass where the tip of the internal electrode is found.

The tip of the reference electrode’s cathode is inside the body of the probe. On the outside and end of the inner tube is the anodized end. The reference electrode is usually made of the same type of material as the internal electrode. Both tubes, interior and exterior, contain a reference solution. Only the outer tube has contact with the measured solution through a porous cap which acts as a saline bridge.\nThis device acts like a galvanized cell. The reference electrode \nis the internal tube of the pH meter probe, which cannot lose ions through interactions with the surrounding environment. Therefore as a reference, it remains static (unchangeable) during the measuring process. The external tube of the probe contains the medium which is allowed  to mix with the external environment. As a result, this tube must be fi lled periodically with a potassium chloride solution (KCI) \nfor restoring the capacity of the electrode which would otherwise be inhibited by a loss of ions and evaporation. \nThe glass bulb on the lower part of the pH electrode acts \nas a measuring element and is covered with a layer of hydrated gel on its exterior and interior. Metallic sodium cations [Na\n+] are diff  used in the hydrated gel outside of \nthe glass and in the solution, while the hydrogen ions [H+] \nare diff  used in the gel. This gel makes the pH electrode \nion-selective:  Hydrogen ions [H+] cannot pass through the \nglass membrane of the pH electrode. Sodium ions [Na+] pass \nthrough and cause a change in free energy, which the pH meter measures. A brief explanation of the theory on how electrodes function is included in the appendix at the end of the chapter.pH METER COMPONENTS \nA pH meter generally has the following components: 1. The body of the instrument containing the circuits, \ncontrols, connectors, display screens and measuring scales.  The following are among some of its most \nimportant components:\na) An ON and OFF switch.  Not all pH meters have an \non and off   switch. Some simply have a cord with a \nplug which allows it to be connected to a suitable electrical outlet.\nb) Temperature control.  This control allows \nadjustments according to the temperature of the solution measured.\nc) Calibration controls.  Depending on the design, \npH meters possess one or two calibration buttons or dials. Normally these are identifi  ed by Cal 1  and \nCal 2 . If the pH meter is calibrated using only one \nsolution, the Cal 1 button is used; making sure that Cal 2 is set at a 100%. If the pH meter allows  two point calibrations, two known pH solutions covering the range of pH to be measured are used. In this case, the two controls are used (Cal 1 and Cal 2). In special cases, a three-point calibration must be done (using three known pH solutions).\nd) Mode selector.  The functions generally included \nin this control are:I. Standby mode (0).  In this position the electrodes \nare protected from electrical currents. It is the position used for maintaining the equipment while stored. \nII. pH mode.  In this position the equipment can \ntake pH measurements after performing the required calibration procedures.\n4KCI KCIHigh Impedance\nVoltmeter\nTemperature\nRegulator\nReference\nTerminal\nSaline Mesh BridgeSolution Under AnalysisSpecial Glass Permeable to IonsActive TermimalAg/AgCI ElectrodeFigure 4.

Place electrodes in the calibration solution.  \n2.1 Submerge the electrode in the standardization \nsolution in such a manner that its lower extremity does not touch the bottom of the beaker. This decreases the risk of breaking the electrode. If the test requires that the solution be kept in motion using the magnetic agitator, special care must be taken so that the agitation rod does not hit the electrode as this could break it. Buff  er solution \nis used as a calibration solution, because its pH is known and therefore will still be maintained even if a little contamination occurs. In general, a solution of pH = 7 is used for this purpose\n1.\n3. Turn the functions selector from Standby position to \npH position.  \n3.1 T his action connects the electrode to the pH \nmeasuring scale in the pH meter. \n3.2 Adjust the meter to read the pH of the calibration \nsolution using the button marked Cal 1. This enables the meter to read the pH of the calibration solution. \n For example: For a solution at pH = 7, the needle can oscillate slightly in units of 0.1 pH; on average, the reading should be 7. The reading of the meter (reading scale) should be done perpendicularly, to avoid or eliminate parallel-type errors (reading errors produced by the shadow of the meter’s needle, visible on the mirror of the reading scale). The pH meter is then ready (calibrated), to carry out the correct pH readings.\n3.3. Put the functions selector in the Standby \nposition.\n4.

When the pH has to be measured in numerous solutions, the pH meter must be calibrated frequently, following the steps previously described. \n5.

In the laboratory, the balance is used \nfor weighing as part of quality control activities (on devices like pipettes), in the preparation of mixtures of components in predefined proportions and in the determination of specifi  c densities or weights.\nOPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThere are diff  erences in design, principles and criteria of \nmetrology amongst balances. At present, there are two large groups of balances: mechanical and electronic balances. \nMechanical balances \nThe following are some of the more common ones: 1. Spring balance.  Its function is based on a mechanical \nproperty of springs as the force exercised on a spring is proportional to the spring’s elasticity constant [k], multiplied by its elongation [x] [F = -kx]. The greater the mass [m] placed on the balance’s plate, the greater the elongation will be, given that the elongation is proportional to the mass and the spring’s constant. The calibration of a spring balance depends on the force of gravity acting on the object weighed. This type of balance is used when great precision is not necessary.\n2. Sliding weight balance.  This type of balance is \nequipped with two known weights which can be moved on setting scales (one macro, the other micro). Upon placing a substance of unknown mass on the tray, its weight is determined by moving the weight on both setting scales until the equilibrium position is reached. At this point, the weight is obtained by adding both quantities indicated by the sliding masses’ position on the scale. \n3. Analytical balance.  This balance functions by comparing \nknown weight masses with that of a substance of unknown weight. It is composed of a base on a bar or symmetrical lever, maintained by a blade-like support on a central point called a fulcrum. At its ends, there are stirrups, also supported with blades which allow these to oscillate smoothly. From there, two plates are suspended. Certifi  ed weights are placed on one \nof the plates and unknown weights on the other. The balance has a securing system or lock, which allows the main lever to remain stable when not in use or when it is necessary to modify the counter-weights. The balance is inside an external box which protects it from interferences, such as air currents. Analytical balances can weigh ten thousandths of a gram (0.0001 g) or 100 thousandths of a gram (0.00001 g). This type of balance generally has a capacity of up to 200 grams. \nXSpring Without Load\nDisplacement\nMeasuring Scale\nMass\nF=mgF=-kxSpring With Load\nm\nF = F1\n-kx = mgFigure 7.

Upper plate balance (Top loading or parallel guidance \nbalance).  This type of balance has a loading plate located \non its upper part, supported by a column maintained in a vertical position by two pairs of guides with fl  exible \nconnections. The eff  ect of the force produced by the \nmass is transmitted from a point on the vertical column directly or by some mechanical means to the loading cell. The requirement with this type of mechanism is that parallel guides must be maintained with exactitude of up to ± 1  µm. Deviations in parallelism cause an error known \nas lateral load (when the mass being weighed shows diff erences if the reading is taken at the centre of the \nplate or on one of its sides). The diagram shown below explains the operation principle some manufacturers have introduced in electronic balances.\n5. Substitution Balance (Unequal-lever arm or two-\nknife balance).  This is a balance with a single plate. \nAn unknown mass is placed on the weighing plate. It is weighed by removing known masses from the counterweight side until it reaches a balanced position, using a mechanical system of cams. The fulcrum is generally off  -centre in relation to the length of the load \nbeam and located near the front of the balance. When a mass is placed on the weight plate and the balance’s locking mechanism is released, the movement of the load beam is projected through an optical system to a screen located on the front part of the instrument.\nOperation veriﬁ  cation\nThe procedure used for verifying the functioning of a typical \nmechanical balanc e is described below. The described \nprocess is based on the substitution balance.1. Verify that the balance is levelled. The levelling is \nachieved using a ring-shaped adjustment mechanism located on the base of the balance or by adjusting a bubble or knob on a scale located on the front of the balance’s base.\n2. Test the  zero mechanism. Place the controls on zero \nand free the balance. If the reading does not stay at zero, adjust the zero mechanism (a grooved screw located in a horizontal position near the fulcrum). To do this, it is necessary to block the balance and slightly adjust the mechanism. The process is to be continued until the zero adjusts correctly on the reading scale.3. Verify and adjust the sensitivity. This is always readjusted \nwhenever some internal adjustment is done. It is performed with a known standard according to the following steps:\na) Lock the balance.b) Place a standard weight (equivalent to the optical \nscale range) on the plate. \nc) Position the micro setting to one (1). d) Release the balance. e) Adjust to the zero position.f) Position the micro setting to zero (0). The balance \nshould indicate 100. If the scale displays less or more than 100, the sensitivity control must be adjusted.

Verify the plate’s brake. It is mounted on a threaded \naxis which touches the plate in order to prevent it from oscillating when the balance is locked. In case of an imbalance, the axis must be rotated slightly until the distance between the break and the plate is zero when the balance is locked.\nMaintenance of the mechanical balance\nThe maintenance of mechanical balances is limited to the following routines:\nFrequency: Daily1.

Disassemble and clean the internal components. This \nmust be done according to the process outlined by the manufacturer or a specialized fi  rm must be contracted \nto do so.\nElectronic balances\nThe electronic balances have three basic components:1. A weighing plate. The object to be weighed placed \non the weighing plate exercises a pressure distributed randomly over the surface of the plate. By means of a transfer mechanism (levers, supports, guides), the weight’s load is concentrated on a simple force [F] which can be measured. [F = ∫P∂a]. The pressure’s integral part \non the area allows the force to be calculated.\n2. A measuring device known as “load cell” produces an \nexit signal corresponding to the load’s force in the form of changes in the voltage or frequency.\n3. A digital analogous electronic circuit shows the fi  nal \nresult of the weight digitally.\nLaboratory balances operate according to the principle \nof compensation of the electromagnetic force applicable to displacements or torques. The combination of their mechanical components and automatic reading systems provides weight measurements at defi  ned levels of accuracy \ndepending on the model.\nPrinciple.  The mobile parts (weighing plate, support \ncolumn [a], bobbin, position and load indicator [G] -the object in the process of being weighed-) are maintained in equilibrium by a compensation force [F] equal to the weight. The compensation force is generated by an electrical current through a bobbin in the air gap of a cylindrical electromagnet. The force F is calculated with the equation [F = I x L x B] where: I = electrical intensity, L = total length of the wire of the coil and B = magnetic fl  ow intensity in the \nelectromagnet’s air gap.With any change in the load (weight/mass), the mobile \nmechanical system responds by moving vertically a fraction of distance. Detected by a photosensor [e], an electrical signal is sent to the servo-amplifi  er [f]. This changes the \nfl ow of electrical current passing through the bobbin of the \nmagnet [c] in such a manner that the mobile system returns to the balanced position upon adjusting of the magnetic fl ow in the electromagnet. Consequently, the weight of \nthe mass [G] can be measured indirectly at the start of the electrical current fl  ow, which passes through the circuit \nmeasuring the voltage [V] by means of a precision resistor [R], [V = I x R]. To date, many systems developed use the electronic system for carrying out very exact measurements of mass and weight.

For this reason, the operator is only responsible \nfor minimal maintenance limited to the following:\nDaily Activities\n1. Clean the weighing plate so that it is kept free of dust. \nCleaning is done b y using a piece of clean cloth which \nmay be dampened with distilled water. If there is a stain, a mild detergent can be applied. Also a paintbrush with soft bristles can be used to remove particles or dust deposited on the weight plate.\n2. Clean the weighing chamber, externally and internally. \nVerify that the glass is free from dust.\n3. Verify that the adjustment mechanisms on the front \ndoor of the weighing chamber works adequately.4. Always use a clean, pre-weighed container for weighing \n(glass container or weighing paper if possible). Note that plastic can become electromagnetically charged and is not recommended for weighing powdered or granulated chemicals.\n5. Any spill must be cleaned immediately to avoid corrosion \nor contamination. Use 70% ethanol to disinfect the pan of the balance. \nVery important:  Never lubricate a balance unless the \nmanufacturer has expressly indicated it. Any substance interfering with the mechanism of the balance retards its response or defi  nitely alters the measurement process.\nNote:  In general, the manufacturer or the specialized \ninstallation representative carries out the maintenance of the balances, according to procedures which vary depending on the type and model.\n1 Guidelines for calibration in laboratories, Drinking Water Inspectorate by \nLGC (Teddington) Ltd., December 2000.

The requirement with this type of mechanism is that parallel guides must be maintained with exactitude of up to ± 1  µm. Deviations in parallelism cause an error known \nas lateral load (when the mass being weighed shows diff erences if the reading is taken at the centre of the \nplate or on one of its sides). The diagram shown below explains the operation principle some manufacturers have introduced in electronic balances.\n5. Substitution Balance (Unequal-lever arm or two-\nknife balance).  This is a balance with a single plate. \nAn unknown mass is placed on the weighing plate. It is weighed by removing known masses from the counterweight side until it reaches a balanced position, using a mechanical system of cams. The fulcrum is generally off  -centre in relation to the length of the load \nbeam and located near the front of the balance. When a mass is placed on the weight plate and the balance’s locking mechanism is released, the movement of the load beam is projected through an optical system to a screen located on the front part of the instrument.\nOperation veriﬁ  cation\nThe procedure used for verifying the functioning of a typical \nmechanical balanc e is described below. The described \nprocess is based on the substitution balance.1. Verify that the balance is levelled.

The balance \nshould indicate 100. If the scale displays less or more than 100, the sensitivity control must be adjusted. This requires locking the balance, opening the upper cover and turning the sensitivity screw: If the scale registers more than 100; turn the screw in a clockwise position. If the scale registers less than 100, it is necessary to unwind the screw anticlockwise.

The word comes from the Latin terms bis which means two and lanx , plate. The balance has other names \nsuch as scale and weight. It must be taken into account that the weight is the force which the gravitational fi  eld exercises on a body’s mass, this force being the product of the mass \nby the local acceleration of gravity [F = m x g]. The term local is used to emphasize that this acceleration depends on factors such as the geographical latitude, altitude and the Earth’s density where the measurement is taken. This force is measured in Newtons.\nGMDN Code 10261 10263 45513 46548\nECRI Code 10-261 10-263 18-449 18-451\nDenomination Balances Electronic balances Analytical electronic \nbalancesMicro analytical, \nmicroelectronic balances\nPhoto courtesy of Acculab CorporationPhoto courtesy of Ohaus Corporation\nPhoto courtesy o f Ohaus Corporatio n\nPHOTOGRAPHS OF BALANCES\nMechanical balance Electronic balance', 'Title: data.pdfCHAPTER 4  BALANCES\n22PURPOSE OF THE BALANCE\nThe balance is used for measuring the mass of a body or \nsubstanc e or its weight. In the laboratory, the balance is used \nfor weighing as part of quality control activities (on devices like pipettes), in the preparation of mixtures of components in predefined proportions and in the determination of specifi  c densities or weights.\nOPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThere are diff  erences in design, principles and criteria of \nmetrology amongst balances. At present, there are two large groups of balances: mechanical and electronic balances. \nMechanical balances \nThe following are some of the more common ones: 1. Spring balance.  Its function is based on a mechanical \nproperty of springs as the force exercised on a spring is proportional to the spring’s elasticity constant [k], multiplied by its elongation [x] [F = -kx]. The greater the mass [m] placed on the balance’s plate, the greater the elongation will be, given that the elongation is proportional to the mass and the spring’s constant. The calibration of a spring balance depends on the force of gravity acting on the object weighed. This type of balance is used when great precision is not necessary.\n2. Sliding weight balance.  This type of balance is \nequipped with two known weights which can be moved on setting scales (one macro, the other micro). Upon placing a substance of unknown mass on the tray, its weight is determined by moving the weight on both setting scales until the equilibrium position is reached. At this point, the weight is obtained by adding both quantities indicated by the sliding masses’ position on the scale. \n3. Analytical balance.  This balance functions by comparing \nknown weight masses with that of a substance of unknown weight. It is composed of a base on a bar or symmetrical lever, maintained by a blade-like support on a central point called a fulcrum. At its ends, there are stirrups, also supported with blades which allow these to oscillate smoothly. From there, two plates are suspended. Certifi  ed weights are placed on one \nof the plates and unknown weights on the other. The balance has a securing system or lock, which allows the main lever to remain stable when not in use or when it is necessary to modify the counter-weights. The balance is inside an external box which protects it from interferences, such as air currents. Analytical balances can weigh ten thousandths of a gram (0.0001 g) or 100 thousandths of a gram (0.00001 g). This type of balance generally has a capacity of up to 200 grams. \nXSpring Without Load\nDisplacement\nMeasuring Scale\nMass\nF=mgF=-kxSpring With Load\nm\nF = F1\n-kx = mgFigure 7.

What installation requirements are needed for accurate balance measurements?,"The balance should be placed on a stable, vibration-free surface in a dust-free environment, away from drafts or temperature fluctuations.","['Title: data.pdfCHAPTER 4  BALANCES\n26Electronic balance controls\nA diagram of the typical controls on a modern electronic \nbalanc e is shown in Figure 15. From this diagram it is \nnecessary to point out the following:1. Numerous functions are incorporated.2. Various measuring units can be selected. 3. It is possible to know the day and hour when the \nmeasurements were taken. \n4. The processes done can be documented and printed.5. It is possible to select the language. \nINSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS\nFor the satisfactory installation and use of a balance, the following is required:\n1. An environment with no air currents or sudden changes \nin temperature and free from dust.\n2. A perfectly levelled table/counter. A platform of high \ninertia, isolated from the structures located in its vicinity is ideal to reduce the eff  ect of vibrations from certain \nequipment such as centrifuges and refrigerators. There must be a large enough area for installing the balance and any auxiliary equipment needed during the weighing processes. Likewise, the space required for cables such as the interconnection, electrical current cables and the information system connection to the printer must be anticipated.\n3. Avoid installing equipment which produces elevated \nmagnetic fi  elds or vibrations like centrifuges, electrical \nmotors, compressors and generators in its vicinity.\n4. Avoid locating it directly under the air-conditioning \nsystem (air currents) and sunlight.\n5. An electrical outlet which complies with the current \nelectrical standards in the country or the laboratory. It must be in good condition and equipped with a ground pole and switches.Electronic balance operation\nThe operation of a modern electronic balance is clearly detailed in its operat or’s manual from the manufacturer. In \ngeneral, it must conform to the following procedure:1. Allow the balance to equilibrate with the environment \nwhere it is installed. \n2. Allow the balance to warm-up before initiating activities. \nNormally it is suffi   cient to have it connected to the \nelectrical feed system. Some manufacturers suggest at least 20 minutes from the moment it is energized until use. Analytical balances Class 1 require at least 2 hours for warming before initiating use. \nVerify that the balance is calibrated. Electronic \nbalances generally have a factory-made calibration stored in memory which can be used if it does not have calibration masses. If calibration is required, use calibrated masses as indicated by the manufacturer. The calibrated masses must conform or exceed the ASTM tolerances. For general information, the following table shows the accepted tolerance for the ASTM Class 1\n1 \nmasses.\n3. Follow the instructions indicated in the manufacturer’s \noperations manual.\nCalibration of balances\nThe calibration of balances must be done b y personnel specially \ntrained for this activity. It should be highlighted that it must be done based on the alignments of the OIML or an equivalent body such as the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), institutions which have developed methodologies for classifying standard weights.

This changes the \nfl ow of electrical current passing through the bobbin of the \nmagnet [c] in such a manner that the mobile system returns to the balanced position upon adjusting of the magnetic fl ow in the electromagnet. Consequently, the weight of \nthe mass [G] can be measured indirectly at the start of the electrical current fl  ow, which passes through the circuit \nmeasuring the voltage [V] by means of a precision resistor [R], [V = I x R]. To date, many systems developed use the electronic system for carrying out very exact measurements of mass and weight.

The set is \ngenerally composed of the following pieces:\n4. Upper plate balance (Top loading or parallel guidance \nbalance).  This type of balance has a loading plate located \non its upper part, supported by a column maintained in a vertical position by two pairs of guides with fl  exible \nconnections. The eff  ect of the force produced by the \nmass is transmitted from a point on the vertical column directly or by some mechanical means to the loading cell. The requirement with this type of mechanism is that parallel guides must be maintained with exactitude of up to ± 1  µm. Deviations in parallelism cause an error known \nas lateral load (when the mass being weighed shows diff erences if the reading is taken at the centre of the \nplate or on one of its sides). The diagram shown below explains the operation principle some manufacturers have introduced in electronic balances.\n5. Substitution Balance (Unequal-lever arm or two-\nknife balance).  This is a balance with a single plate. \nAn unknown mass is placed on the weighing plate. It is weighed by removing known masses from the counterweight side until it reaches a balanced position, using a mechanical system of cams. The fulcrum is generally off  -centre in relation to the length of the load \nbeam and located near the front of the balance. When a mass is placed on the weight plate and the balance’s locking mechanism is released, the movement of the load beam is projected through an optical system to a screen located on the front part of the instrument.\nOperation veriﬁ  cation\nThe procedure used for verifying the functioning of a typical \nmechanical balanc e is described below. The described \nprocess is based on the substitution balance.1. Verify that the balance is levelled. The levelling is \nachieved using a ring-shaped adjustment mechanism located on the base of the balance or by adjusting a bubble or knob on a scale located on the front of the balance’s base.\n2. Test the  zero mechanism. Place the controls on zero \nand free the balance. If the reading does not stay at zero, adjust the zero mechanism (a grooved screw located in a horizontal position near the fulcrum). To do this, it is necessary to block the balance and slightly adjust the mechanism. The process is to be continued until the zero adjusts correctly on the reading scale.3. Verify and adjust the sensitivity. This is always readjusted \nwhenever some internal adjustment is done. It is performed with a known standard according to the following steps:\na) Lock the balance.b) Place a standard weight (equivalent to the optical \nscale range) on the plate. \nc) Position the micro setting to one (1). d) Release the balance. e) Adjust to the zero position.f) Position the micro setting to zero (0). The balance \nshould indicate 100. If the scale displays less or more than 100, the sensitivity control must be adjusted. This requires locking the balance, opening the upper cover and turning the sensitivity screw: If the scale registers more than 100; turn the screw in a clockwise position. If the scale registers less than 100, it is necessary to unwind the screw anticlockwise. Repeat the process until the balance is adjusted (adjusting the zero and the sensitivity).Type of mass Capacity\nSimple pieces \n 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 g \n100, 200 and 500 g \nFractional pieces \n 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 mg \n100, 200 and 500 mg \nMass\nPlate\nFlexible\nConnections\nSupport ColumnFGFigure 10.

It is possible to know the day and hour when the \nmeasurements were taken. \n4. The processes done can be documented and printed.5. It is possible to select the language. \nINSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS\nFor the satisfactory installation and use of a balance, the following is required:\n1. An environment with no air currents or sudden changes \nin temperature and free from dust.\n2. A perfectly levelled table/counter. A platform of high \ninertia, isolated from the structures located in its vicinity is ideal to reduce the eff  ect of vibrations from certain \nequipment such as centrifuges and refrigerators. There must be a large enough area for installing the balance and any auxiliary equipment needed during the weighing processes. Likewise, the space required for cables such as the interconnection, electrical current cables and the information system connection to the printer must be anticipated.\n3. Avoid installing equipment which produces elevated \nmagnetic fi  elds or vibrations like centrifuges, electrical \nmotors, compressors and generators in its vicinity.\n4. Avoid locating it directly under the air-conditioning \nsystem (air currents) and sunlight.\n5. An electrical outlet which complies with the current \nelectrical standards in the country or the laboratory. It must be in good condition and equipped with a ground pole and switches.Electronic balance operation\nThe operation of a modern electronic balance is clearly detailed in its operat or’s manual from the manufacturer. In \ngeneral, it must conform to the following procedure:1. Allow the balance to equilibrate with the environment \nwhere it is installed. \n2. Allow the balance to warm-up before initiating activities. \nNormally it is suffi   cient to have it connected to the \nelectrical feed system. Some manufacturers suggest at least 20 minutes from the moment it is energized until use. Analytical balances Class 1 require at least 2 hours for warming before initiating use. \nVerify that the balance is calibrated. Electronic \nbalances generally have a factory-made calibration stored in memory which can be used if it does not have calibration masses. If calibration is required, use calibrated masses as indicated by the manufacturer. The calibrated masses must conform or exceed the ASTM tolerances. For general information, the following table shows the accepted tolerance for the ASTM Class 1\n1 \nmasses.\n3. Follow the instructions indicated in the manufacturer’s \noperations manual.\nCalibration of balances\nThe calibration of balances must be done b y personnel specially \ntrained for this activity. It should be highlighted that it must be done based on the alignments of the OIML or an equivalent body such as the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), institutions which have developed methodologies for classifying standard weights.

Verify the plate’s brake. It is mounted on a threaded \naxis which touches the plate in order to prevent it from oscillating when the balance is locked. In case of an imbalance, the axis must be rotated slightly until the distance between the break and the plate is zero when the balance is locked.\nMaintenance of the mechanical balance\nThe maintenance of mechanical balances is limited to the following routines:\nFrequency: Daily1. Verify the level. 2. Verify the zero setting.3. Verify the sensitivity adjustment. 4. Clean the weighing plate. \nFrequency: Annually\n1. Calibrate the balance and document the process. 2. Disassemble and clean the internal components. This \nmust be done according to the process outlined by the manufacturer or a specialized fi  rm must be contracted \nto do so.\nElectronic balances\nThe electronic balances have three basic components:1. A weighing plate. The object to be weighed placed \non the weighing plate exercises a pressure distributed randomly over the surface of the plate. By means of a transfer mechanism (levers, supports, guides), the weight’s load is concentrated on a simple force [F] which can be measured. [F = ∫P∂a]. The pressure’s integral part \non the area allows the force to be calculated.\n2. A measuring device known as “load cell” produces an \nexit signal corresponding to the load’s force in the form of changes in the voltage or frequency.\n3. A digital analogous electronic circuit shows the fi  nal \nresult of the weight digitally.\nLaboratory balances operate according to the principle \nof compensation of the electromagnetic force applicable to displacements or torques. The combination of their mechanical components and automatic reading systems provides weight measurements at defi  ned levels of accuracy \ndepending on the model.\nPrinciple.  The mobile parts (weighing plate, support \ncolumn [a], bobbin, position and load indicator [G] -the object in the process of being weighed-) are maintained in equilibrium by a compensation force [F] equal to the weight. The compensation force is generated by an electrical current through a bobbin in the air gap of a cylindrical electromagnet. The force F is calculated with the equation [F = I x L x B] where: I = electrical intensity, L = total length of the wire of the coil and B = magnetic fl  ow intensity in the \nelectromagnet’s air gap.With any change in the load (weight/mass), the mobile \nmechanical system responds by moving vertically a fraction of distance.

In the laboratory, the balance is used \nfor weighing as part of quality control activities (on devices like pipettes), in the preparation of mixtures of components in predefined proportions and in the determination of specifi  c densities or weights.\nOPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThere are diff  erences in design, principles and criteria of \nmetrology amongst balances. At present, there are two large groups of balances: mechanical and electronic balances. \nMechanical balances \nThe following are some of the more common ones: 1. Spring balance.  Its function is based on a mechanical \nproperty of springs as the force exercised on a spring is proportional to the spring’s elasticity constant [k], multiplied by its elongation [x] [F = -kx]. The greater the mass [m] placed on the balance’s plate, the greater the elongation will be, given that the elongation is proportional to the mass and the spring’s constant. The calibration of a spring balance depends on the force of gravity acting on the object weighed. This type of balance is used when great precision is not necessary.\n2. Sliding weight balance.  This type of balance is \nequipped with two known weights which can be moved on setting scales (one macro, the other micro). Upon placing a substance of unknown mass on the tray, its weight is determined by moving the weight on both setting scales until the equilibrium position is reached. At this point, the weight is obtained by adding both quantities indicated by the sliding masses’ position on the scale. \n3. Analytical balance.  This balance functions by comparing \nknown weight masses with that of a substance of unknown weight. It is composed of a base on a bar or symmetrical lever, maintained by a blade-like support on a central point called a fulcrum. At its ends, there are stirrups, also supported with blades which allow these to oscillate smoothly. From there, two plates are suspended. Certifi  ed weights are placed on one \nof the plates and unknown weights on the other. The balance has a securing system or lock, which allows the main lever to remain stable when not in use or when it is necessary to modify the counter-weights. The balance is inside an external box which protects it from interferences, such as air currents. Analytical balances can weigh ten thousandths of a gram (0.0001 g) or 100 thousandths of a gram (0.00001 g). This type of balance generally has a capacity of up to 200 grams. \nXSpring Without Load\nDisplacement\nMeasuring Scale\nMass\nF=mgF=-kxSpring With Load\nm\nF = F1\n-kx = mgFigure 7.

These are also cal led agitators.\nDiff using tray.  Device located at the bottom of the water bath to support the containers located inside the tank. It also allows thermal conve ction currents generated \nin the fl  uid contained in the tank to circulate from top to bottom and back to the top, maintaining the temperature homogeneous  at the level selected by the operator. \nIn general the diff  using tray is made of stainless steel. \nElectrostatic painting.  A painting process that uses the particle-attracting property of electrostatic charges. A potential diff  erence of 80-150kV is applied to a \ngrid of wires through which the paint is sprayed to charge each particle. The metal objects to be sprayed are connected to the opposite terminal of the high-voltage \ncircuit, so that they attract the particles of paint. The piece covered with paint particles is then placed in an electrical ov en to melt the particles, making them adhere \nstrongly to the piece.\nFuse.  A safety device which protects the electrical circuits from excessive current. Fuses are made of materials whose dimensions an d properties equip them to \nwork well within some predefi  ned conditions. If for some reason the design parameters are exceeded, the material burns out and interrupts the passage of the \nelectrical current.\nImmersion resistor . An electrical resistor (see defi  nition below) inside of a sealed tube. These are generally used for heating fl  uids as water o r oil. \nResistance.  Opposition that a material or electrical circuit imposes to the fl  ow of electric current. It is the property of a circuit that  transforms electrical energy \ninto heat as it opposes the fl  ow of current.

What is the main purpose of a biological safety cabinet in a laboratory?,The biological safety cabinet is designed to provide a safe working environment for handling infectious or hazardous materials by preventing exposure to harmful biological agents.,"['Title: data.pdfMAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n35Chapter 6\nBiological Safety Cabinet\nThis equipment is designed for controlling aerosols and \nmicroparticles associated with managing potentially toxic or infectious biological material in laboratories in activities such as agitation, centrifugation, pipetting, and opening of pressurized containers. Safety cabinets have been designed to protect the user, the environment and the sample manipulated using appropriate ventilation conditions. They are also known as laminar fl  ow cabinets  \nand/or  biosafety cabinets .\nILLUSTRATION OF A BIOLOGICAL SAFETY CABINETPURPOSES OF THE EQUIPMENT\nThe biological safety cabinet is used for the following:\n1. To protect the worker from risks associated with the \nmanagement of potentially infectious biological material.\n2. To protect the sample being analyzed from becoming \ncontaminated. \n3. To protect the environment. \nThe cabinets are used for routine work related to pathogens \n(parasites, bacteria, virus, fungus), cell culture and under very precise conditions, the management of toxic agents.\nOPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThe biological safety cabinet is a chamber generally constructed of steel. It has a front glass window of adjustable \nheight, a ventilation system with an electrical motor, a ventilator and a set of ducts which while functioning, generate a negative pressure condition inside the cabinet. This forces the air to fl  ow from inside the cabinet through \nthe front opening to generate a curtain of air protecting the operator. Internally, the air is conducted through a series of grids and ducts to be finally treated in HEPA\n1  \nfi lters. Depending on the design of the cabinet, the air is \nrecycled inside the laboratory or extracted and renewed in diverse proportions. The air fl  ow, which in Class II cabinets \nmoves from the fi  lter towards the work surface, is laminar. A \nsummary of the existing type of cabinets and their principal characteristics is presented next.\n1 HEPA: High Effi   ciency Particulate Air.\nGMDN Code 15698 20652 20653 20654\nECRI Code 15-698 20-652 20-653 20-654\nDenomination Cabinets, biological \nsafetyCabinets, biological \nsafety, class ICabinets, biological \nsafety, class IICabinets, biological \nsafety, class III\nFigure 19.

Risk level 1 group  is composed of biological agents \nvery unlikely to cause sickness in healthy humans or animals. (No individual and community risk). \n2. Risk level 2 group  is composed of pathogens which \ncause sickness in humans or animals but unlikely to be dangerous to laboratory workers, the community, domestic animals or the environment under normal circumstances. Those exposed in the laboratory rarely become seriously ill. There are preventive measures and effective treatment available and the risk of dissemination is limited.

Risk level 3 group  is composed of pathogens which \nusually cause serious sicknesses to human beings and animals and produce a serious economic impact.\nHowever, infection by casual contact by one \nindividual to another is not common. The sicknesses these produce are treatable by antimicrobial or anti-parasitic agents. (High individual risk, low community risk).\n4. Risk level 4 group  is composed of pathogens which \nusually produce very serious sicknesses in human beings or animals, frequently without treatments available. These agents are easily spread from one individual to another or from animal to human being or vice versa, directly or indirectly or by casual contact. (High individual risk, high community risk).\nINSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS\nThe following are requirements for a cabinet to function adequat ely: \n1. A laboratory area protected from air currents from \nwindows or air-conditioning systems. The cabinet must also be located far from the laboratory circulation zones in order to avoid air currents that could affect the curtain of air inside the cabinet.

An electrical connection equipped with the respective \ncontrol and safety elements; the electrical outlet with a ground pole.\n3. A levelled and fi  rm table designed for supporting the \nweight of the cabinet and allowing the operator to work comfortably. There must be free space for placing the feet and its height must be adequate.4. The floor on which it is located must be flat and \nlevelled.\n5. The free space around the cabinet recommended by the \nmanufacturer must be respected. Likewise, the height of the room must be verifi  ed (the ceiling must be of \nrecommended height so that it can function without hindrance). \n6. Type B cabinets must have an extraction duct equipped \nwith the following required control devices: regulating valves that allow the flow of air to be isolated and regulated.\n7. Gas connections must be in the immediate vicinity of \nthe cabinet in order to facilitate the connection to these service valves.\n8. The cabinet must be certifi  ed annually to verify that it \ncomplies with the established requirements in the NSF 49 Regulation.\nUSE OF THE SAFETY CABINET\nCorrect utilization of the biological safety cabinet is achieved by complying with the following instructions:\n1.

To protect the worker from risks associated with the \nmanagement of potentially infectious biological material.\n2. To protect the sample being analyzed from becoming \ncontaminated. \n3. To protect the environment. \nThe cabinets are used for routine work related to pathogens \n(parasites, bacteria, virus, fungus), cell culture and under very precise conditions, the management of toxic agents.\nOPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThe biological safety cabinet is a chamber generally constructed of steel. It has a front glass window of adjustable \nheight, a ventilation system with an electrical motor, a ventilator and a set of ducts which while functioning, generate a negative pressure condition inside the cabinet. This forces the air to fl  ow from inside the cabinet through \nthe front opening to generate a curtain of air protecting the operator.

A laboratory area protected from air currents from \nwindows or air-conditioning systems. The cabinet must also be located far from the laboratory circulation zones in order to avoid air currents that could affect the curtain of air inside the cabinet. It must also be verifi  ed \nthat the cabinet is not installed alongside other types of cabinets such as chemical hoods.\n2. An electrical connection equipped with the respective \ncontrol and safety elements; the electrical outlet with a ground pole.\n3. A levelled and fi  rm table designed for supporting the \nweight of the cabinet and allowing the operator to work comfortably. There must be free space for placing the feet and its height must be adequate.4. The floor on which it is located must be flat and \nlevelled.\n5. The free space around the cabinet recommended by the \nmanufacturer must be respected. Likewise, the height of the room must be verifi  ed (the ceiling must be of \nrecommended height so that it can function without hindrance). \n6. Type B cabinets must have an extraction duct equipped \nwith the following required control devices: regulating valves that allow the flow of air to be isolated and regulated.\n7. Gas connections must be in the immediate vicinity of \nthe cabinet in order to facilitate the connection to these service valves.\n8. The cabinet must be certifi  ed annually to verify that it \ncomplies with the established requirements in the NSF 49 Regulation.\nUSE OF THE SAFETY CABINET\nCorrect utilization of the biological safety cabinet is achieved by complying with the following instructions:\n1. Plan the work to be done in the biological safety cabinet \nin advance. Determine what procedure and equipment will be used. Coordinate the time of the cabinet’s use with the other laboratory professionals in order to avoid interruption or undesired traffi   c while it is in use.\n2. Turn on the cabinet. Turn off   the UV lamp if lit. Turn on \nthe fl  uorescent light lamp and the cabinet’s ventilator. \nVerify that the grids in front and behind are free of obstructions. Prepare the work area. Allow the cabinet to function for at least 15 minutes.\n3. Wash hands and forearms with germicidal soap. Put on \nthe personal protective apparel: coat/overall with long sleeves and adjustable cuff  s, protective eyeglasses and \nmask if the work requires it. Prepare the interior surfaces of the cabinet applying 70% ethanol or a suitable disinfectant. After this, let the air fl  ow through.\n4. Only load and install the materials and equipment \nrequired for the test or manipulation. Distinguish between the clean areas and dirty areas. Place the material in such a way that the clean materials do not mix or cross used or dirty materials or impede the circulation of the internal air through the front and back grids. Place a biosafety bag for disposing waste materials, a container with disinfectant for the pipettes and a container for storing sharps. Avoid locating very large objects near one another. Upon fi  nalizing the placing of the materials, the fl  ow of air must be allowed \nto sweep through the cabinet for approximately 3 to 5 minutes in order to eliminate any particle produced or freed during the loading of materials and equipment.\n5. Initiate activities. Slowly introduce hands into', 'Title: data.pdfCHAPTER 6  BIOLOGICAL SAFETY CABINET\n40\npotentially contaminated areas). Keep the materials \nat least 10 cm behind the front grid. Try to perform the most risky and contaminating activities towards the back of the cabinet’s work area. Avoid the use of open fl  ames of lighters since this breaks the laminar \nfl ow pattern and may burn the fi  lter. Avoid removing \nhands from the work area until all procedures are accomplished and the potentially dangerous materials are disposed of in the biosafety bag or in the pipette and sharp containers.\n6. Clean the cabinet, allowing the air to fl  ow freely for 3 to \n5 minutes upon ending all the procedures.\n7. Decontaminate the surfaces of all the materials \nand equipment in contact with the biologically contaminated material. Apply 70% ethanol or a suitable disinfectant and allow drying. Lift the equipment and materials and disinfect the area underneath. Cover the open containers before removal from the work area. Transfer materials to their appropriate place (incubator, autoclave, etc.). \n8. Discard the gloves and remove personal protective \nelements. Dispose of these following the laboratory’s established procedure. Wash hands with a lot of water and soap.\n9. Turn off   the ventilator, the fl  uorescent lamp, close the \nfront opening and turn on the ultraviolet light.\nNote:  In case of a leak or spill inside the cabinet while in \nuse, it must be kept in operation and all the objects or equipment involved must undergo a process of surface decontamination. This will prevent the cabinet from releasing contaminants.\nDecontamination of the cabinet\nThe decontamination of the biological safety cabinet is an activity which must be done before any maintenance work \ninvolving opening its surfaces or internal components. Whenever any of the processes indicated next are needed, decontamination of the cabinet must be done previously.1. Changing of fi  lters.\n2.

Before conducting certifi  cation tests when the cabinet \nhas been used with classifi  ed agents such as level 2 or \n3 biological risk agents. \n4. Before moving the cabinet to a diff  erent location. \n5. After a spill of a material containing high risk agents.\nThe most suitable decontamination procedure must be \ndefined by the professional responsible for industrial safety and professional risks. In annex G of the NSF 49 Standard, the procedure for decontaminating the cabinet using depolymerised paraformaldehyde is described. Only professionals who have received the relevant training must conduct such procedures.ROUTINE MAINTENANCE\nWarning:  The maintenance of internal components must \nonly be done by trained and qualifi  ed personnel. In order \nto carry out maintenance on the internal components, decontamination must be done previously. Personal protection must be worn to perform the routines.\nGeneral maintenance required for the biological safety \ncabinet is for the most part simple to perform. The routines and frequencies are shown below:Frequency: Weekly1. Decontaminate the work surface and the interior \nsurfaces of the cabinet with 70% ethanol. \n2. Clean the front glass door and the surface of the \nultraviolet lamp, using a domestic cleaning solution.\n3. Verify the precision of the manometer’s reading, \nindicating any fall in pressure fl  owing through the HEPA \nfi lter. Register the date and the reading in the cabinet’s \nlog book.\nFrequency: Monthly\n1. Clean the exterior surfaces, especially the front and \nthe upper part using a piece of damp cloth in order to remove the dust.\n2. Disinfect the surface of the lower compartment with \n70% Ethanol or a suitable disinfecting solution.\n3. Verify the state of the service valves. 4. Do the tasks due on a weekly basis. \nFrequency: Annually\n1. Carry out the certification process according to \nestablished outlines in the NSF 49 regulation.\n2.

The \ncentrifuge is designed to use the centrifugal force generated in rotational movements to separate the constitutive elements of a mixture. There is a wide range of centrifuges capable of serving specifi  c industry and research needs. This \nchapter focuses on standing centrifuges normally used in public health and clinical laboratories.\nPHOTOGRAPH OF CENTRIFUGEPURPOSE OF THE CENTRIFUGE\nThe centrifuge uses centrifugal force (the force generated \nwhen an objec t rotates around a single point), for separating \nsolids suspended in a liquid by sedimentation, or liquids of diverse density. The rotational movements allow forces much greater than gravity to be generated in controlled periods of time. In the laboratory, centrifuges are generally used in processes such as the separation of solid components from biological liquids through sedimentation and in particular of blood components: red cells, white cells, platelets among others and for conducting multiple tests and treatments.There are several kinds of centrifuges. The most widely used in public health, surveillance and clinical laboratories are the table-top centrifuge, the ultracentrifuge, the haeamatocrit centrifuge and the standing centrifuge.\nOPERATION PRINCIPLES \nCentrifuges represent a practical application of Newton’s law of motion.

The \ncentrifuge is designed to use the centrifugal force generated in rotational movements to separate the constitutive elements of a mixture. There is a wide range of centrifuges capable of serving specifi  c industry and research needs. This \nchapter focuses on standing centrifuges normally used in public health and clinical laboratories.\nPHOTOGRAPH OF CENTRIFUGEPURPOSE OF THE CENTRIFUGE\nThe centrifuge uses centrifugal force (the force generated \nwhen an objec t rotates around a single point), for separating \nsolids suspended in a liquid by sedimentation, or liquids of diverse density. The rotational movements allow forces much greater than gravity to be generated in controlled periods of time. In the laboratory, centrifuges are generally used in processes such as the separation of solid components from biological liquids through sedimentation and in particular of blood components: red cells, white cells, platelets among others and for conducting multiple tests and treatments.There are several kinds of centrifuges. The most widely used in public health, surveillance and clinical laboratories are the table-top centrifuge, the ultracentrifuge, the haeamatocrit centrifuge and the standing centrifuge.\nOPERATION PRINCIPLES \nCentrifuges represent a practical application of Newton’s law of motion. When a body of mass [m] turns around \na central point [O], it is subjected to a centripetal  force \n[N] directed towards the rotation axis with a magnitude N = mω\n2R, where [m] is the mass of the body, [R] is the radius \nand ω is the angular speed. Centrifuges possess a rotating axis on which is mounted a rotor with sample receiving compartments. Tangential speed is defi  ned by the following \nequation: VT=ωR.\nPhoto courtesy of Beckman Coulter', 'Title: data.pdfCHAPTER 7  CENTRIFUGE\n506.

Avoid using automatic dishwashers.\n2. Avoid using alcohol and acetone since such liquids aff  ect \nthe structure of the tubes.

Verify if the tubes are reusable or not. If they are \ndisposable, use them only once.\n5. For sterilizing, it is necessary to verify the material from \nwhich the tube is made, as not all can stand sterilization by heat. Glass tubes are normally sterilized with vapour at 121 °C for 30 minutes.\n6. Store tubes and bottles in a dark, fresh, dry place, \nfar from chemical vapours or ultraviolet radiation sources.\n7.

Information on the compatibility of the rotor with other \nmodels of centrifuges from the same manufacturer.\nRecently manufactured centrifuges have incorporated \nnumerous improvements into their design to provide greater safety and longer operational life. Among advances mentioned are controls based on microprocessors. By means of software  controlled by a keyboard, these have several \ndiff erent operational programs in memory. According to the \ntype of rotor being used and procedure conducted, these programs control the centrifugation time, the required temperature, the rotor’s revolutions, the acceleration and deceleration, alarms warning the operator about any anomaly during operation.\nManufacturers have also incorporated induction motors \n(without brushes) in centrifuges. These have the advantage of electronically controlling currents and magnetic fields regulating the rotor’s speed which reduces the frequency of maintenance. Operation and maintenance of such equipment must be carried out according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.\nINSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS\nCentrifuges require the following for normal operation:1. An electrical connection with a capacity suitable for the \nequipment providing stable single phase or triphase type voltage (depending on the model and specifi  cation \ngiven by the manufacturer). In general, centrifuges use 110V or 220 V/60 Hz.\n2. A clean, dust free environment with a fi  rm levelled \nfl oor.\n3. If the centrifuge is refrigerated, it needs a free space on \nthe side of the condenser for adequate heat transfer.\n4. A cabinet in which the centrifuge accessories such as \nthe alternate rotors can be kept. \nROUTINE MAINTENANCE\nThe routine maintenance required by a centrifuge depends on multiple fac tors such as the incorporated technology, \nusage intensity, training of users, quality of the electrical feed and environmental conditions. The following are general recommendations regarding adequate use and most common maintenance for guaranteeing correct operation. The routines or specialized repairs will depend on manufacturers’ recommendations for each brand and model. Always disinfect the rotor bowl, centrifuge head, buckets and trunnion rings as applicable before any servicing of centrifuges used to prepare clinical or infectious samples.\nPriority recommendation. Verify that only qualifi  ed personnel \ntrained and familiar with the use, care, risks and handling of the centrifuge operates it. It is the laboratory directors’ responsibility to supervise and take necessary precautions so that personnel operating centrifuges understand the implications of working with such equipment. \nAPPROPRIATE MANAGEMENT AND STORAGE RECOMMEND ATIONS\n1\nRotors\n1. Register the date of purchase of each one of the rotors, \nincluding inf ormation related to the serial and model \nnumber.\n2. Read and understand the rotor manuals, equipment \nand tubes before use. Comply with indications for use and care specifi  ed by the manufacturer.\n3. Use rotors only in centrifuges for which these have \nbeen manufactured. Do not interchange rotors without verifying the compatibility with the centrifuge.\n4. Register operation parameters for each rotor in a log \nbook in order to determine its remaining operational life and to acquire its replacements when needed.\n5. Use the recommendations regarding maximum speed \nand sample density from the manufacturer. Each rotor is designed for supporting a maximum level of eff  ort; \nthese specifi  cations must be followed rigorously.\n1 http://www.sunysb.edu/facilities/ehs/lab/cs.shtmlk=lnrmaxrmin ()\nω2×1013\n3600']","The installation requirements for a centrifuge include an electrical connection with a suitable capacity, a clean and dust-free environment with a firm levelled floor, a cabinet for storing accessories, and adherence to manufacturer's recommendations."

Obey the recommendation related to reducing the \noperation speed when working with high density solutions in stainless steel tubes or plastic adaptors. Manufacturers provide the related information.\n7. Use titanium rotors if working with saline solutions \nfrequently.\n8. Protect the rotors’ coating in order to avoid the metal \nbase from deteriorating. Do not use alkaline detergents or cleaning solutions which can remove the protective fi lm. The rotors generally made of aluminium [Al] are \ncovered by a fi  lm of anodized aluminium which protects \ntheir metal structure. \n9. Use plastic brushes when cleaning the rotor. Metal \nbrushes scratch the protective coating and generate sources for future corrosion. Corrosion is accelerated in operation conditions and shortens the rotor’s operational life.\n10. If there are spills of corrosive substances, wash the rotor \nimmediately.\n11. Air dry the rotor once cleaned and washed with water.12. Store vertical tube rotors and almost vertical tube rotors \nwith the larger side facing downwards and without their covers.\n13. Store rotors in a dry area. Avoid leaving them in the \ncentrifuge.\n14. Store swinging buckets rotors without the compartments’ \ncovers. \n15.

Never try to open the cover of a centrifuge while it is \nfunctioning and never try to stop the rotor by hand.\nTubes \nTube care includes aspects such as fi  lling of the tubes, adequat e temperature selection, centrifugation speed \nlimitations, washing and sterilization. The principle recommendations are the following:1. Wash tubes, adaptors and other accessories by hand \nusing a 1:10 mild detergent solution in water and a soft textured brush (not metallic). Avoid using automatic dishwashers.\n2. Avoid using alcohol and acetone since such liquids aff  ect \nthe structure of the tubes. Manufacturers recommend the solvent to be used with each type of centrifugation tube material. \n3. Avoid drying tubes in a drying oven. Dry always with a \nstream of hot air.4. Verify if the tubes are reusable or not. If they are \ndisposable, use them only once.\n5. For sterilizing, it is necessary to verify the material from \nwhich the tube is made, as not all can stand sterilization by heat. Glass tubes are normally sterilized with vapour at 121 °C for 30 minutes.\n6. Store tubes and bottles in a dark, fresh, dry place, \nfar from chemical vapours or ultraviolet radiation sources.\n7. Verify maximum fi  lling levels and the sealing of thin \nwall tubes in order to avoid collapse inside the rotor by the action of the centrifugal force. Comply with manufacturers recommendations. \nPreventive maintenance\nWarning:  Nev er carry out a technical intervention in a \ncentrifuge if it has not been previously decontaminated.\nThe most important maintenance routines performed on a \ncentrifuge are the following:Frequency: Monthly1. Verify that the centrifuge external components are free \nof dust and stains. Avoid aff  ecting the rotor with spills. \nClean the rotor compartment using a mild detergent. \n2. Test that the rotors’ connecting and adjustment \nmechanisms are in good condition. Keep the points lubricated as the manufacturer recommends.\n3. Verify the locking /safety mechanism of the centrifuge’s \ncover. This is fundamental in guaranteeing operators’ safety as this mechanism keeps the cover of the centrifuge closed while the rotor is turning.\n4. Check the lubrication state of elements such as for \nO-rings as the manufacturer recommends. Always use lubricants according to the manufacturer’s instructions (frequency and type of lubricants). In recently manufactured centrifuges, there are sealed ball bearings which do not require lubrication.\n5. Verify the state of gaskets and watertight joints.\nFrequency: Annually\n1. Verify that electronic cards are clean and well connected.2.

The \ncentrifuge is designed to use the centrifugal force generated in rotational movements to separate the constitutive elements of a mixture. There is a wide range of centrifuges capable of serving specifi  c industry and research needs. This \nchapter focuses on standing centrifuges normally used in public health and clinical laboratories.\nPHOTOGRAPH OF CENTRIFUGEPURPOSE OF THE CENTRIFUGE\nThe centrifuge uses centrifugal force (the force generated \nwhen an objec t rotates around a single point), for separating \nsolids suspended in a liquid by sedimentation, or liquids of diverse density. The rotational movements allow forces much greater than gravity to be generated in controlled periods of time. In the laboratory, centrifuges are generally used in processes such as the separation of solid components from biological liquids through sedimentation and in particular of blood components: red cells, white cells, platelets among others and for conducting multiple tests and treatments.There are several kinds of centrifuges. The most widely used in public health, surveillance and clinical laboratories are the table-top centrifuge, the ultracentrifuge, the haeamatocrit centrifuge and the standing centrifuge.\nOPERATION PRINCIPLES \nCentrifuges represent a practical application of Newton’s law of motion. When a body of mass [m] turns around \na central point [O], it is subjected to a centripetal  force \n[N] directed towards the rotation axis with a magnitude N = mω\n2R, where [m] is the mass of the body, [R] is the radius \nand ω is the angular speed. Centrifuges possess a rotating axis on which is mounted a rotor with sample receiving compartments. Tangential speed is defi  ned by the following \nequation: VT=ωR.\nPhoto courtesy of Beckman Coulter']","When using a centrifuge, it is crucial to follow safety precautions such as never opening the cover while it is in operation, avoiding the use of expired rotors, using a shield when working with radioactive materials, and ensuring that rotors are loaded or unloaded inside a biological safety cabinet if necessary.

A levelled and fi  rm table designed for supporting the \nweight of the cabinet and allowing the operator to work comfortably. There must be free space for placing the feet and its height must be adequate.4. The floor on which it is located must be flat and \nlevelled.\n5. The free space around the cabinet recommended by the \nmanufacturer must be respected. Likewise, the height of the room must be verifi  ed (the ceiling must be of \nrecommended height so that it can function without hindrance). \n6. Type B cabinets must have an extraction duct equipped \nwith the following required control devices: regulating valves that allow the flow of air to be isolated and regulated.\n7. Gas connections must be in the immediate vicinity of \nthe cabinet in order to facilitate the connection to these service valves.\n8. The cabinet must be certifi  ed annually to verify that it \ncomplies with the established requirements in the NSF 49 Regulation.\nUSE OF THE SAFETY CABINET\nCorrect utilization of the biological safety cabinet is achieved by complying with the following instructions:\n1. Plan the work to be done in the biological safety cabinet \nin advance. Determine what procedure and equipment will be used. Coordinate the time of the cabinet’s use with the other laboratory professionals in order to avoid interruption or undesired traffi   c while it is in use.\n2. Turn on the cabinet.

The following are general recommendations regarding adequate use and most common maintenance for guaranteeing correct operation. The routines or specialized repairs will depend on manufacturers’ recommendations for each brand and model. Always disinfect the rotor bowl, centrifuge head, buckets and trunnion rings as applicable before any servicing of centrifuges used to prepare clinical or infectious samples.\nPriority recommendation. Verify that only qualifi  ed personnel \ntrained and familiar with the use, care, risks and handling of the centrifuge operates it. It is the laboratory directors’ responsibility to supervise and take necessary precautions so that personnel operating centrifuges understand the implications of working with such equipment. \nAPPROPRIATE MANAGEMENT AND STORAGE RECOMMEND ATIONS\n1\nRotors\n1.

What is the purpose of a water distiller in a laboratory?,"A water distiller purifies water by boiling it and condensing the steam, removing impurities such as minerals, salts, and contaminants.","['Title: data.pdfMAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n53Chapter 8\nWater Distiller\nThe word distiller  comes from the Latin word distillare  \nwhich means to vaporize liquids through heat. The water distiller, also called distillation unit or water still, used in the laboratory, purifi  es running water by means of controlled \nvaporization and cooling processes. Upon applying thermal energy to water in a liquid phase by a warming process, it is changed into vapour. This allows the water molecules to separate from the molecules of other substances mixed or diluted. The water vapour is collected and passed through a condenser, where it is cooled and returned to the liquid phase. Then, the condensed water is collected into a diff  erent storage tank.

Distilled water is characterized by a lack of solids in suspension. It is used in multiple applications in centres which provide health services, especially in laboratory units, in washing, sterilization and dietetics. The more specialized the procedures are in the laboratory, the greater will be the level of purity required. For example: the preparation of reagents or biological material requires water of the highest quality. Distillation is one of the fundamental processes to achieve this (although it may not be the only one required). Water used in laboratories must be free of pyrogens, with a concentration of total solids no greater than 1 ppm, a pH value between 5.4 and 7.2 and an electrical resistance of at least 3 x 10\n5 ohm/cm at 25 °C1.\n1 Warming cabinets, sterilizers, and associated equipment , Division 11– \nEquipment, USACE/NAVFAC/ AFCESA, UFGS-11710, July 2003.

Remove the protective panel or open the door allowing \naccess to the boiling tank or vapour generator.\n2. Remove the cover of the boiling tank.3. Visually verify if the interior walls or the immersion \nresistors show solid deposits or sediments. The quantity of deposits present depends on the quality of water fed to the distiller. If there is an accumulation of sediments, it must be cleaned to avoid damaging the resistors\n1.\n4. Clean accumulated deposits. In general, the cleaning \nprocess requires a chemical product especially designed for removing them. The product must be selected according to the characteristics of the water used. This is determined by a chemical analysis. \n5. Drain water from the generator tank until its level is \napproximately 10 cm above the location of the water level probe or the immersion resistance (verify that the water level is higher than the base of the tank to ensure that all of the elements stay submerged in water).\n6.

The more specialized the procedures are in the laboratory, the greater will be the level of purity required. For example: the preparation of reagents or biological material requires water of the highest quality. Distillation is one of the fundamental processes to achieve this (although it may not be the only one required). Water used in laboratories must be free of pyrogens, with a concentration of total solids no greater than 1 ppm, a pH value between 5.4 and 7.2 and an electrical resistance of at least 3 x 10\n5 ohm/cm at 25 °C1.\n1 Warming cabinets, sterilizers, and associated equipment , Division 11– \nEquipment, USACE/NAVFAC/ AFCESA, UFGS-11710, July 2003.

The \nenergy coming from the sun heats the water from the seas and transforms part of it into water vapour. This vapour is concentrated in clouds. When atmospheric conditions are suitable, these cool and condense the water which returns to the surface of the Earth in the form of rain.\nFunctioning of the water distiller\nThe water distiller reproduces the natural phenomenon described abo ve. The configuration and design vary \ndepending on the volume of water required. The following is a general explanation of the components of a distiller and a description of how these function. 1. Vapour generator.  Also known as the boiling tank, \nthis component is the container where the water to be distilled is stored. In general, it has a hydraulic connection which allows the water evaporated and distilled to be replenished. It is generally made of glass in small distillers or of stainless steel with copper, tin or titanium coverings in large capacity machines. It can have level, fl  ow and water quality feed controls, which \nprotect the distiller in case some irregularity in the water supply occurs. As a source of energy, it uses the water vapour coming from a boiler or vapour generator, or the thermal energy from electrical immersion resistors through direct conduction. These cause the water temperature to rise until, in normal conditions (atmospheric pressure equal to an atmosphere and gravity acceleration equal to 9.80665 m/s\n2) water in the \nliquid phase is transformed into vapour at 100 °C.\n2. Water level.  Device which allows the quantity of water \nto be regulated inside the vapour generator. It is joined directly to the connection which supplies the water used by the distiller. When the quantity of water in liquid phase contained in the boiling tank decreases, the device allows the quantity of liquid evaporated to be recovered.\n3. Control valve.  Mechanical or electromechanical device \nwhich allows the fl  ow of water towards the vapour generator tank to be regulated.\n4. Hydraulic connection.  Network which supplies water \nin liquid phase to the vapour generator tank.\n5. Water in liquid phase.  Water inside the vapour generator \ntank. It receives thermal energy from the immersion resistors and it is converted to vapour when the required temperature and pressure conditions are met.\n6. Immersion resistors.  Devices generating heat when \nan electrical current circulates through them. These are isolated by a ceramic cap and protected from the external environment by a metal shield.\n7. Refrigeration water outlet. Line carrying the water \nused for condensing the water vapour thus removing the thermal energy from it (cooling).8. Condenser.  Device in which the vapour loses thermal \nenergy, cools and returns to its liquid phase. In order to accelerate the process, forced convection by low temperature fl  uid circulation (air or water) around the \nline through which the vapour fl  ows is used.\n9. Filter.  Distillers have activated carbon fi  lters located at \nthe exit of the condenser or collector. These eliminate fl avours or particles which may be present in the vapour \nbeing condensed.\n10. Distilled water container.  Device in which the fl  uid \ncompleting the distillation process is collected. Distilled water must be stored in special plastic containers to avoid ionic contamination. Polyethylene, polypropylene or polytetrafl  uoroethylene containers are generally used.\nINSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS \nDepending on the design, capacity and type of distiller, \nthe r equired installation may vary. The most common \nrequirements are the following:1. A well ventilated environment in which the equipment \ncan be installed. This is necessary because the distiller transfers heat to a fl  uid and increases the temperature \nof the area where it is installed. It is necessary to leave free space around the distiller so that the fl  ow of air is \nfacilitated. Some distillers are assembled inside a metal box and need to be installed on a support to facilitate the circulation of air under them.\n2. A potable water connection. Typically the required \nhydraulic connection has a diameter of 1/2” . To ensure a smooth operation, the quality of the water feeding the distiller must be evaluated to determine if it is necessary to install a treatment system\n1 to prevent the presence \nof incrustations or sediments in the vapour generating tank and on immersion resistors. Potable water is used for feeding the vapour generator and for refrigerating the condenser\n2.\n3. A distilled water connection. The distilled water produced \nis initially collected into a storage tank. In large capacity equipment, it is distributed', 'Title: data.pdfMAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n53Chapter 8\nWater Distiller\nThe word distiller  comes from the Latin word distillare  \nwhich means to vaporize liquids through heat.

3. **Prepare a chlorine bleach solution**: Mix a chlorine bleach solution with a concentration of 200 ppm and add it to the storage tank.

4. **Allow the solution to interact**: Let the bleach solution interact with the tank for at least three hours.

5. **Drain the tank**: After the interaction period, drain the storage tank using the drainage line.

6. **Install the activated carbon filter**: Remove the activated carbon filter from its housing and install it back into the tank.

7. **Fill the tank with distilled water**: Allow the distiller to fill the storage tank with distilled water. The activated carbon filter will remove any remnants of chlorine bleach used.

It should be of a suitable size so that there is working space at the side of the microplate reader. The required complementary equipment for conducting the technique described above is: washer, incubator, dispenser and computer with its peripheral attachments. \n3. An electrical supply source, which complies with the \ncountry’s norms and standards. In the countries of the Americas for example, 110 V and 60 Hertz frequencies are generally used, whereas other regions of the World use 220-240V, 50/60HZ.\nCalibration of the microplate reader \nThe calibration of a microplate reader is a specialized process which must be ex ecuted by a technician or trained engineer \nfollowing the instructions provided by each manufacturer. In order to do the calibration, it is necessary to have a set of grey fi  lters mounted on a plate of equal geometric size \nto those used in the analyses. Manufacturers provide these calibration plates for any wavelength the equipment uses. \nCalibration plates are equipped with at least three pre-\nestablished optic density values within the measurement ranges; low, medium, and high value. In order to perform the calibration, follow this process:1. Place the calibration plate on the equipment. 2. Carry out a complete reading with the calibration plate. \nVerify if there are diff  erences in the readings obtained \nfrom well to well. If this is the case, invert the plate (180°) and repeat the reading to rule out that diff  erences are \nattributed to the plate itself. In general, it is accepted that the instrument does not need further calibration if the plate results are as expected at two wavelengths. \n3. Verify if the reader requires calibration. If so, proceed \nwith the calibration following the routine outlined by the manufacturer, verifying that the reading’s linearity is maintained as rigorously as possible. \n4. If the instrument does not have a calibration plate, verify \nit by placing a coloured solution in the wells of a plate and immediately carry out a complete reading. Then invert the plate 180° and read the plate again. If both readings display identical, average values in each row, the reader is calibrated. 5. Verify that the reader is calibrated, column by column. \nPlace a clean, empty plate and carry out a reading. If there is no diff  erence between each of the average \nreading of the fi  rst to the last column, it can be assumed \nthat the reader is calibrated.\nROUTINE MAINTENANCE \nMaintenance described next focuses exclusively on the micr oplate reader. The maintenance of the microplate \nwasher is described in Chapter 2.\nBasic maintenance \nFrequency: Daily1. Review that optical sensors of each channel are clean. \nIf dirt is detected, clean the surface of the windows of the light emitters and the sensors with a small brush.\n2. Confi  rm that the lighting system is clean.\n3. Verify that the reader’s calibration is adequate. When \nthe daily operations begin, let the reader warm up for 30 minutes. Next, do a blank reading and then read a full plate of substrate. The readings must be identical. If not, invert the plate and repeat the reading in order to determine if the deviation originated in the plate or the reader.\n4. Examine the automatic drawer sliding system. It must \nbe smooth and constant.\nPreventive maintenance\nFrequency: Quarterly1. Verify the stability of the lamp. Use the calibration plate, \nconducting readings with intervals of 30 minutes with the same plate. Compare readings. There must be no diff erences. \n2. Clean the detectors’ optical systems and the lighting \nsystems. \n3. Clean the plate drawer. 4. Verify the alignment of each well with the light emission \nand detection systems.', 'Title: data.pdfMAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n61\nDispenser system\nThe dispenser system is composed of a set of high precision \nsyringes and devic es called dispensers, through which \nfl uids are supplied according to their volumes and selected \nvelocities. These syringes are selected and installed in the dilutor depending on the densities, viscosities, and volumes of fluids to be manipulated. The fluids are transported through flexible tubes, whose diameters, lengths and chemical compatibility are taken into account in the design and manufacturing process for suitability with the selected activity. These tubes are linked using connections manually adjustable.

In general, the voltage is 220-240 V, 50/60 Hz.\nNote:  Always verify manufacturer’s recommendations on \ninstallation to ensure the distiller is operating according to the specifi  cations.\nROUTINE MAINTENANCE \nThe maintenance depends on the design and capacity of \nthe distiller . The maintenance described in this manual \nfocuses on a distiller equipped with a stainless steel vapour generator tank with immersion resistors and a condenser refrigerated through a ventilator impelling air (on or through the condenser’s diff  using fi  ns). \nWarning:  Before carrying out an inspection or routine \nmaintenance, verify that the distiller is turned off and disconnected from the electrical source.\nInspection and cleaning of the vapour generator tank\nFrequency: Monthly1. Remove the protective panel or open the door allowing \naccess to the boiling tank or vapour generator.\n2. Remove the cover of the boiling tank.3. Visually verify if the interior walls or the immersion \nresistors show solid deposits or sediments. The quantity of deposits present depends on the quality of water fed to the distiller. If there is an accumulation of sediments, it must be cleaned to avoid damaging the resistors\n1.\n4. Clean accumulated deposits. In general, the cleaning \nprocess requires a chemical product especially designed for removing them. The product must be selected according to the characteristics of the water used. This is determined by a chemical analysis. \n5. Drain water from the generator tank until its level is \napproximately 10 cm above the location of the water level probe or the immersion resistance (verify that the water level is higher than the base of the tank to ensure that all of the elements stay submerged in water).\n6. Add the chemical product recommended for the type \nof water used.\n7. Mix well.8. Allow the chemical to act overnight or as recommended \nby the manufacturer. \n9. Drain the contents of the tank on the following morning.\n10. Add clean water, wash and drain until the chemical \nhas been completely removed along with the mineral residues from the aff  ected surfaces.\n11. Reinstall the cover.12. Place the front panels or adjust the door.13. Operate the equipment normally.\nWarning:  Under no circumstances, should the solution used \nfor removing sediments be distilled.\nChange of the activated carbon ﬁ  lter\nFrequency: Every three months \nNormally , the activated carbon fi  lter is submerged in water \nbelow the dispenser system which comes from the distilled water storage tank. It is assembled on a casing installed on the distilled water distribution line. In general, it is a device which can be easily substituted. The following process is generally done:1. Unscrew the top of the fi  lter. \n2. Remove the used fi  ltering element. \n3. Install a new element with the same characteristics as \nthe original.\n4. Reinstall the top of the fi  lter.\nWarning:  The fi  lter is adjusted inside its casing by means \nof O-rings or gaskets that must be installed carefully within their grooves in order to avoid leaks of distilled water.\nCleaning of the condenser\nFrequency: Annually 1. In order to clean the condenser, it is necessary to remove \nthe protective panels or open the door, giving access to the condenser.\n2. Verify that the distiller is disconnected from the electrical \noutlet.\n3. Remove the condenser. Disconnect the linkage system \nfor the entry of vapour and the connection which links the condenser to the distilled product storage tank.\n4. Remove screws joining the ventilator with the condenser. \nDisconnect the ventilator terminals from its connection points.\n5. Remove the ventilator and clean the dirt accumulated \non the blades. Lubricate the rotation axis with mineral oil (two drops).\n6. Remove the condenser. Aspirate dirt, dust and fl  uff   \naccumulated on the surface of the diffusing fins. Compressed air or a brush dampened with soap and water can also be used.\n7. Rinse the parts.8. Dry.9. Assemble again in the reverse order to that described.\nSterilization of the distilled water storage tank1 The minerals deposited on the cover of the immersion resistors are \nparticularly poor heat conductors in that they impede an effi   cient transfer \nof heat between the immersion resistance and the water in the distillation process. This makes the temperature of the resistance rise above that it would reach in normal operating conditions, deteriorating its condition and integrity..

The following table shows an example of how they are classifi  ed according to their size \nand managed volumes.\nOpposite, the components of the dispensing system (syringe \nand dispenser) are shown.\nINSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS\nThe dilutor must be installed on a clean, dry and extremely levelled counter or work surface, far from areas where there \nmay be vapours which can aff  ect its functioning. \nThere must be free space around the equipment for \nfacilitating ventilation and the passage of cables and interconnection lines and cables with the solvent containers, computers or supply systems. The space around the dilutor should be approximately 10 cm. \nThere must be a 115 V, 60 Hz electrical outlet in good \ncondition with a ground pole or alternatively one of 220–240 V, 50/60 Hz, depending on the manufacturer’s specifi  cations \nand/or the electrical norms in the country of use.ROUTINE MAINTENANCE \nThe routine maintenance focuses mainly on eliminating contaminants which may accumulate inside the fluid \nmechanisms and/or lines. The most common routines are the following:\nCleaning of exterior surfaces\nFrequency: Daily\nWarning:  Disconnect the dilutor from the electrical feed \noutlet before beginning the external cleaning process.\n1. Clean the exterior surfaces using a clean piece of cloth \ndampened with a mild detergent mixed with water.\n2. Lightly rub the surfaces of the dilutor and the \naccessories.\n3.

Place electrodes in the calibration solution.  \n2.1 Submerge the electrode in the standardization \nsolution in such a manner that its lower extremity does not touch the bottom of the beaker. This decreases the risk of breaking the electrode. If the test requires that the solution be kept in motion using the magnetic agitator, special care must be taken so that the agitation rod does not hit the electrode as this could break it. Buff  er solution \nis used as a calibration solution, because its pH is known and therefore will still be maintained even if a little contamination occurs. In general, a solution of pH = 7 is used for this purpose\n1.\n3. Turn the functions selector from Standby position to \npH position.  \n3.1 T his action connects the electrode to the pH \nmeasuring scale in the pH meter. \n3.2 Adjust the meter to read the pH of the calibration \nsolution using the button marked Cal 1. This enables the meter to read the pH of the calibration solution. \n For example: For a solution at pH = 7, the needle can oscillate slightly in units of 0.1 pH; on average, the reading should be 7. The reading of the meter (reading scale) should be done perpendicularly, to avoid or eliminate parallel-type errors (reading errors produced by the shadow of the meter’s needle, visible on the mirror of the reading scale). The pH meter is then ready (calibrated), to carry out the correct pH readings.\n3.3. Put the functions selector in the Standby \nposition.\n4. Measuring the pH of a solution.  \n4.1 Remove the electrode from the calibration \nsolution.\n4.2 Rinse the electrode with distilled water and dry \nit.\n4.3 Place the electrode in the solution of unknown \npH.\n4.4 Turn the functions selector from the Standby \nposition to the pH position. \n4.5 Read the pH of the solution on the meter’s scale or \nthe screen. Register the reading obtained on the control sheet. \n4.6 Turn the functions selector again to the Standby \nposition.\n If it is necessary to measure the pH of more than one solution, repeat the previously described procedures, rinsing the probe with distilled water and drying with clean, lint-free paper between readings. When the pH has to be measured in numerous solutions, the pH meter must be calibrated frequently, following the steps previously described. \n5. Turn off the pH meter.  \n5.1 Remove the electrode from the last solution \nanalyzed. \n5.2 R inse the electrode in distilled water and dry it with \na drying material that will not penetrate it. \n5.3 Place the electrode in its storage container. 5.4 Verify that the functions selector is in the Standby \nposition. \n5.5 Activate the off switch or disconnect the feed \ncable, if it lacks this control. \n5.6 Clean the work area. \nGENERAL MAINTENANCE OF THE pH METER\npH meters have two general maintenance procedures: one c oncerning the analyzer’s body, the other for the pH \ndetection probe (electrodes).   \nGeneral maintenance procedures for the pH meter’s body\nFrequency: Every six months \n1. Examine the exterior of the equipment and evaluate its \ngeneral physical condition. Verify the cleanliness of the covers and their adjustments. \n2. Test the connection cable and its system of connections. \nCheck that they are in good condition and clean. \n3. Examine the equipment controls. Verify that these are \nin good condition and activated without diffi   culty. \n4. Verify that the meter is in good condition. To do this, the \ninstrument must be disconnected from the electric feed line. Adjust the indicator needle to zero (0) using the adjustment screw generally found below the pivot of the indicator needle. If the equipment has an indicator screen, check that it is functioning normally. \n5. Confi  rm that the on indicator (bulb or diode) operates \nnormally. \n6. Verify the state of the electrode carrying arm. Examine \nthe electrode attachment and assembly mechanism to prevent the electrode from becoming loose. Check that the height adjustment operates correctly.\n7. Check the batteries (if applicable); change them if \nnecessary. \n8. Test its function by measuring the pH of a known \nsolution.\n9. Inspect the ground connection and check for escaping \ncurrent. \n1 Verify the type of calibration solution recommended by the electrode \nmanufacturer.
