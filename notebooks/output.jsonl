This technique has a direct application in immunology and serology. Among other applications it confi  rms the \\npresence of antibodies or antigens of an infectious agent in an organism, antibodies from a vaccine or auto-antibodies, for example in rheumatoid arthritis.OPERATION PRINCIPLES\\nThe microplate reader is a specialized spectrophotometer. Unlike the c onventional spectrophotometer which facilitates \\nreadings on a wide range of wavelengths, the microplate reader has filters or diffraction gratings that limit the wavelength range to that used in ELISA, generally between 400 to 750 nm (nanometres). Some readers operate in the ultraviolet range and carry out analyses between 340 to 700 nm. The optical system exploited by many manufacturers uses optic fi  bres to supply light to the microplate wells \\ncontaining the samples. The light beam, passing through the sample has a diameter ranging between 1 to 3 mm. A detection system detects the light coming from the sample, amplifi  es the signal and determines the sample\u2019s \\nabsorbance. A reading system converts it into data allowing the test result interpretation. Some microplate readers use double beam light systems.\\nTest samples are located in specially designed plates with \\na specifi  c number of wells where the procedure or test is \\ncarried out. Plates of 8 columns by 12 rows with a total of 96 wells are common. There are also plates with a greater number of wells. For specialized applications, the current trend is to increase the number of wells (384-well plates) to reduce the amount of reagents and samples used and a greater throughput. The location of the optical sensors of the microplate reader varies depending on the manufacturers: these can be located above the sample plate, or directly underneath the plate\u2019s wells.\\nNowadays microplate readers have controls regulated by \\nmicroprocessors; connection interfaces to information systems; quality and process control programs, which by means of a computer, allow complete test automation.Chapter 1\\nMicroplate Reader\\nGMDN Code 37036\\nECRI Code 16-979\\nDenomination Photometric micro-plate reader\\nPhoto courtesy of BioRad Laboratories ', 'Title: data.pdfMAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\\n3INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS\\nIn order for the microplate reader to operate correctly, the \\nfollowing points need to be respected:  \\n1. A clean, dust free environment. 2. A stable work table away from equipment that vibrates \\n(centrifuges, agitators). It should be of a suitable size so that there is working space at the side of the microplate reader. The required complementary equipment for conducting the technique described above is: washer, incubator, dispenser and computer with its peripheral attachments. \\n3. An electrical supply source, which complies with the \\ncountry\u2019s norms and standards. In the countries of the Americas for example, 110 V and 60 Hertz frequencies are generally used, whereas other regions of the World use 220-240V, 50\/60HZ.\\nCalibration of the microplate reader \\nThe calibration of a microplate reader is a specialized process which must be ex ecuted by a technician or trained engineer \\nfollowing the instructions provided by each manufacturer. In order to do the calibration, it is necessary to have a set of grey fi  lters mounted on a plate of equal geometric size \\nto those used in the analyses. Manufacturers provide these calibration plates for any wavelength the equipment uses. \\nCalibration plates are equipped with at least three pre-\\nestablished optic density values within the measurement ranges; low, medium, and high value. In order to perform the calibration, follow this process:1. Place the calibration plate on the equipment. 2. Carry out a complete reading with the calibration plate. \\nVerify if there are diff  erences in the readings obtained \\nfrom well to well. If this is the case, invert the plate (180\u00b0) and repeat the reading to rule out that diff  erences are \\nattributed to the plate itself. In general, it is accepted that the instrument does not need further calibration if the plate results are as expected at two wavelengths. \\n3. Verify if the reader requires calibration. If so, proceed \\nwith the calibration following the routine outlined by the manufacturer, verifying that the reading\u2019s linearity is maintained as rigorously as possible. \\n4. If the instrument does not have a calibration plate, verify \\nit by placing a coloured solution in the wells of a plate and immediately carry out a complete reading. Then invert the plate 180\u00b0 and read the plate again. If both readings display identical, average values in each row, the reader is calibrated. 5. Verify that the reader is calibrated, column by column. \\nPlace a clean, empty plate and carry out a reading. If there is no diff  erence between each of the average \\nreading of the fi  rst to the last column, it can be assumed \\nthat the reader is calibrated.\\nROUTINE MAINTENANCE \\nMaintenance described next focuses exclusively on the micr oplate reader.

Samples, controls and standards are added to the wells \\nand incubated at temperatures ranging between room temperature and 37 \u00b0C for a determined period of time, according to the test\u2019s characteristics. During the incubation, the sample\u2019s antigen binds to the antibody coated to the plate; or the antibody in the sample binds to the antigen coated on the plate, according to their presence and quantity in the sample analyzed.\\n3. After incubation, the unbound antigen or antibodies are \\nwashed and removed from the plate by the microplate washer using an appropriate washing buff  er.\\n4.

After the incubation, a new washing cycle is done to \\nremove unbound conjugate from the wells.\\n7.  A substrate is added. The enzyme reacts with the \\nsubstrate and causes the solution to change in colour. This will indicate how much antigen-antibody complex is present at the end of the test. \\n8.

The technique \\nis based on the detection of an antigen or antibodies captured on a solid surface using direct or secondary, labelled antibodies, producing a reaction whose product can be read by the spectrophotometer. The word ELISA is the acronym for \u201cEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay\u201d . This chapter covers the use of microplate readers for ELISA testing.

This technique has a direct application in immunology and serology. Among other applications it confi  rms the \\npresence of antibodies or antigens of an infectious agent in an organism, antibodies from a vaccine or auto-antibodies, for example in rheumatoid arthritis.OPERATION PRINCIPLES\\nThe microplate reader is a specialized spectrophotometer. Unlike the c onventional spectrophotometer which facilitates \\nreadings on a wide range of wavelengths, the microplate reader has filters or diffraction gratings that limit the wavelength range to that used in ELISA, generally between 400 to 750 nm (nanometres). Some readers operate in the ultraviolet range and carry out analyses between 340 to 700 nm. The optical system exploited by many manufacturers uses optic fi  bres to supply light to the microplate wells \\ncontaining the samples. The light beam, passing through the sample has a diameter ranging between 1 to 3 mm. A detection system detects the light coming from the sample, amplifi  es the signal and determines the sample\u2019s \\nabsorbance. A reading system converts it into data allowing the test result interpretation. Some microplate readers use double beam light systems.\\nTest samples are located in specially designed plates with \\na specifi  c number of wells where the procedure or test is \\ncarried out. Plates of 8 columns by 12 rows with a total of 96 wells are common. There are also plates with a greater number of wells. For specialized applications, the current trend is to increase the number of wells (384-well plates) to reduce the amount of reagents and samples used and a greater throughput.

The technique \\nis based on the detection of an antigen or antibodies captured on a solid surface using direct or secondary, labelled antibodies, producing a reaction whose product can be read by the spectrophotometer. The word ELISA is the acronym for \u201cEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay\u201d . This chapter covers the use of microplate readers for ELISA testing.

This technique has a direct application in immunology and serology. Among other applications it confi  rms the \\npresence of antibodies or antigens of an infectious agent in an organism, antibodies from a vaccine or auto-antibodies, for example in rheumatoid arthritis.OPERATION PRINCIPLES\\nThe microplate reader is a specialized spectrophotometer. Unlike the c onventional spectrophotometer which facilitates \\nreadings on a wide range of wavelengths, the microplate reader has filters or diffraction gratings that limit the wavelength range to that used in ELISA, generally between 400 to 750 nm (nanometres). Some readers operate in the ultraviolet range and carry out analyses between 340 to 700 nm. The optical system exploited by many manufacturers uses optic fi  bres to supply light to the microplate wells \\ncontaining the samples. The light beam, passing through the sample has a diameter ranging between 1 to 3 mm. A detection system detects the light coming from the sample, amplifi  es the signal and determines the sample\u2019s \\nabsorbance. A reading system converts it into data allowing the test result interpretation. Some microplate readers use double beam light systems.\\nTest samples are located in specially designed plates with \\na specifi  c number of wells where the procedure or test is \\ncarried out. Plates of 8 columns by 12 rows with a total of 96 wells are common. There are also plates with a greater number of wells. For specialized applications, the current trend is to increase the number of wells (384-well plates) to reduce the amount of reagents and samples used and a greater throughput. The location of the optical sensors of the microplate reader varies depending on the manufacturers: these can be located above the sample plate, or directly underneath the plate\u2019s wells.\\nNowadays microplate readers have controls regulated by \\nmicroprocessors; connection interfaces to information systems; quality and process control programs, which by means of a computer, allow complete test automation.Chapter 1\\nMicroplate Reader\\nGMDN Code 37036\\nECRI Code 16-979\\nDenomination Photometric micro-plate reader\\nPhoto courtesy of BioRad Laboratories ']","response":"Routine maintenance for a microplate reader includes the following tasks:\n\n1. **Frequency: Daily**\n   - Review that optical sensors of each channel are clean.

In order to do the calibration, it is necessary to have a set of grey fi  lters mounted on a plate of equal geometric size \\nto those used in the analyses. Manufacturers provide these calibration plates for any wavelength the equipment uses. \\nCalibration plates are equipped with at least three pre-\\nestablished optic density values within the measurement ranges; low, medium, and high value. In order to perform the calibration, follow this process:1. Place the calibration plate on the equipment. 2. Carry out a complete reading with the calibration plate. \\nVerify if there are diff  erences in the readings obtained \\nfrom well to well. If this is the case, invert the plate (180\u00b0) and repeat the reading to rule out that diff  erences are \\nattributed to the plate itself. In general, it is accepted that the instrument does not need further calibration if the plate results are as expected at two wavelengths. \\n3. Verify if the reader requires calibration. If so, proceed \\nwith the calibration following the routine outlined by the manufacturer, verifying that the reading\u2019s linearity is maintained as rigorously as possible. \\n4. If the instrument does not have a calibration plate, verify \\nit by placing a coloured solution in the wells of a plate and immediately carry out a complete reading. Then invert the plate 180\u00b0 and read the plate again. If both readings display identical, average values in each row, the reader is calibrated. 5. Verify that the reader is calibrated, column by column. \\nPlace a clean, empty plate and carry out a reading. If there is no diff  erence between each of the average \\nreading of the fi  rst to the last column, it can be assumed \\nthat the reader is calibrated.\\nROUTINE MAINTENANCE \\nMaintenance described next focuses exclusively on the micr oplate reader.

Depending on the test performed, the washer can intervene from one to four times, supplying the washing buff  er, agitating and \\nremoving the unbound reagents\\n1 until the programmed \\ntimes and cycles are completed. The washer has of two reservoirs; one for the washing buff  er, the other for the waste \\ngenerated during the washing process.OPERATION PRINCIPLES \\nThe microplate washer has been designed to perform washing operations in the ELISA t echnique. The equipment \\npossesses at least, the following subsystems which vary depending on the manufacturer\u2019s design. \\n\u2022\u2022 Control subsystem.  Generally , the washer is controlled \\nby microprocessors allowing programming and controlling steps to be performed by the washer such as: number of washing cycles\\n2 (1\u20135); expected times; \\nsupplying and extracting pressures; plate format (96\u2013384 wells); suction function adjustment according to the type of well\\n3 (fl at bottom, V bottom or rounded \\nbottom or strips used); volumes distributed or aspirated; the soaking and agitation cycles, etc.\\n\u2022\u2022 Supply subsystem.  In general, this comprises a reservoir \\nfor the washing solution; one or several pumps; usually a positive displacement type syringe and a dispenser head that supplies the washing solution to the diff  erent \\nwells by means of needles. The head usually comes with eight pairs of needles for washing and aspirating simultaneously the wells of the same row (the supply and extraction sub-systems converge on the head). There are models with twelve pairs of needles and others that conduct the washing process simultaneously in all the wells.

This requires a vacuum \\nmechanism and a storage system for gathering the fl  uids \\nand waste removed from the wells. The vacuum may be supplied by external and internal pumps. Extraction is done by a set of needles mounted on the washer\/dryer\u2019s head. The number of needles varies from one to three, according to the washer model used.\\n  If it uses only one needle, the washing and \\nextraction operation is done with this single needle. If it uses two needles, one is used for supplying the washing solution and the other for extraction. If it uses three needles, the fi  rst is used for supplying the washing \\nsolution, the second for extraction and the third for controlling (extracting) any excess volume in the well. Generally, the extraction needle is longer than the supply needle, which enables it to advance (vertically) up to a height ranging between 0.3 and 0.5 mm from the bottom of the well.\\n\u2022\u2022 Advance sub-system.  This is composed of a \\nmechanism which moves the supply and extraction head horizontally to reach each well in the ELISA plate. When the horizontal movement to the following row occurs, there is a vertical movement towards the well to dispense or extract the washing solution. There are washers which carry out these operations in a simultaneous manner.The sub-systems previously described are shown in Figure \\n2. Figure 3 shows the diff  erent types of wells most commonly \\nfound in microplates. Each kind of well is suitable for a particular type of test.\\nWashing process\\nThe washing of the microplate is one of the stages of the ELISA t echnique. Special solutions are used in the washing \\nsteps. Among those most commonly used is phosphate buff er solution or PBS. The phosphate buff  er solution has a \\nstability of 2 months if kept at 4 \u00b0C. It is estimated that 1 to 3 litres of solution is required for washing one microplate and that 300 \u00b5l is used in each well per cycle. Washing can \\nbe done manually, but it is preferable to use an automated microplate washer for a better throughput and to minimize handling of potentially contaminated substances.\\nAmong the washing processes used by microplate washers \\nare featured:\\n\u2022\u2022 Aspir ation from top to bottom.  When the aspiration \\nphase is initiated, the needles move vertically and the aspiration is initiated immediately as these enter into the liquid. The process continues until the needles reach their lowest position very close to the bottom of the wells. At this point they are stopped in order to avoid suctioning the air that should fl  ow against the \\ninterior lateral walls of the wells. This type of aspiration prevents air currents from drying the bound protein on the surface of the wells.\\nWaste ReceptacleExtraction Pump\\nSupply and\\nExtraction Head\\nHorizontal and \\nVertical Displacement\\nWells\\nELISA PlateWashing \\nSolutionSupply PumpsPositive Displacement PumpsFigure 2.

In certain \\ntypes of washer, the washing and aspiration systems operate simultaneously, generating a controlled turbulence inside the well which removes the unbound substances during the incubations.\\n\u2022\u2022 Aspir ation from the base of the wells.  In this system, \\nthe aspiration of the fluid contained in the wells is performed initially with the aspiration needles in a position very close to the bottom, immediately beginning a suctioning cycle, usually time-controlled. This system may aspirate air if there are diff  erences in \\nthe levels of the tanks. \\nWasher calibration\\nThe microplate washer is critical for guaranteeing that the ELISA t echnique performs as expected. The alignment to \\nbe taken into account for the eff  ective functioning of the \\nequipment is presented next:\\n\u2022\u2022 Position of the needles (supply and aspiration head).  \\nThe horizontal and vertical position adjustment with respect to the wells must be verifi  ed carefully. If the \\nplate has fl  at bottom wells, the supply needle must be \\nchecked to see that it is situated very close to the well\u2019s wall. If the bottom is round or V-shaped, the suction needle should be located in the centre of the well: upon the vertical movement, a needle-base distance is maintained in the well, usually between 0.3 to 0.5 mm. The needles must never be allowed to touch the bottom of the wells to avoid mechanical interferences between the needle point and the well\u2019s base during the aspiration function.\\n\u2022\u2022 Aspir ation time.  Appropriately adjust the aspiration \\ntime so that a solution fi  lm adhered to the well\u2019s wall \\ncan fl  ow towards the bottom. Avoid very long time lapses to prevent the coating on the wells from drying up. Check that the suction system\u2019s needles are clean (free of obstructions). \\n\u2022\u2022 Distributed V olume.  Check that the volume distributed \\nis as close as possible to the maximum capacity of the well; confi  rm that all the wells are fi  lled uniformly (at \\nthe same level). Verify that the distributing needles are clean (free of obstructions).\\n\u2022\u2022 Vacuum.  The suctioning system must be calibrated \\neffi  ciently. If the vacuum is too strong, the test can \\nbe altered. In fact, it could dry out the wells and considerably weaken the enzyme activity in the wells and completely alter the test result. The majority of washers function with a vacuum ranging between 60 and 70% of atmospheric pressure. In some washers, the vacuum is made in an external pump which operates as an accessory of the washer. Its operation is controlled by the washer, which means that the vacuum pump operates only when required. Washing process veri\ufb01  cation \\nTo verify that the washing process is done according to \\nthe specifications of ELISA t echniques, manufacturers \\nof ELISA tests have developed procedures to be carried out regularly. One of the controls\\n1 is based on using the \\nperoxidase reagent, which is dispensed using a pipette in the plate wells to be read at 405, 450 and 492 nm. At once the wells are washed and a colourless substrate is added (TMB\/H\\n2O2\u2013Tetramethylbenzidine\/Hydrogen Peroxide). \\nWhatever conjugate remains will hydrolyze the enzyme and the chromogen will change to blue. After stopping the reaction with acid, the TMB will turn yellow again. The resulting colour intensity is directly related to the washing process effi   ciency.\\nINSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS\\nFor the microplate washer to operate correctly, the following \\nis nec essary: \\n1. A clean, dust-free environment. 2. A stable work table located away from equipment \\nthat generates vibrations, (centrifuges, and agitators). It must be of a suitable size to locate the necessary complementary equipment: reader, incubator, distributor and computer with its peripheral attachments at the side of the microplate washer.\\n3.\\n An electric outlet in good condition with a ground pole \\nand, an electrical connection which complies with the \\ncountry\u2019s or the laboratory\u2019s norms and standards.

In general, this comprises a reservoir \\nfor the washing solution; one or several pumps; usually a positive displacement type syringe and a dispenser head that supplies the washing solution to the diff  erent \\nwells by means of needles. The head usually comes with eight pairs of needles for washing and aspirating simultaneously the wells of the same row (the supply and extraction sub-systems converge on the head). There are models with twelve pairs of needles and others that conduct the washing process simultaneously in all the wells. Some washers off  er the possibility of working \\nwith diff  erent types of washing solutions, performing \\nthe solution changes according to the program entered by the operator.\\n1 See a brief explication of the ELISA technique in Chapter 1, Microplate \\nReader . \\n2 The exact number of washing operations required depends on the assay \\nused. This is explained in each manufacturer\u2019s test instruction manual.\\n3 If the bottom is fl  at, the suction needle is located very close to one of well\u2019s \\nfaces; if it is rounded or V-shaped, the suction needle is centered. \\nGMDN Code 17489\\nECRI Code 17-489\\nDenomination Micro-plate washer\\nPhoto courtesy of BioRad Laboratories ', 'Title: data.pdfMAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\\n3INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS\\nIn order for the microplate reader to operate correctly, the \\nfollowing points need to be respected:  \\n1. A clean, dust free environment. 2. A stable work table away from equipment that vibrates \\n(centrifuges, agitators). It should be of a suitable size so that there is working space at the side of the microplate reader. The required complementary equipment for conducting the technique described above is: washer, incubator, dispenser and computer with its peripheral attachments. \\n3. An electrical supply source, which complies with the \\ncountry\u2019s norms and standards. In the countries of the Americas for example, 110 V and 60 Hertz frequencies are generally used, whereas other regions of the World use 220-240V, 50\/60HZ.\\nCalibration of the microplate reader \\nThe calibration of a microplate reader is a specialized process which must be ex ecuted by a technician or trained engineer \\nfollowing the instructions provided by each manufacturer. In order to do the calibration, it is necessary to have a set of grey fi  lters mounted on a plate of equal geometric size \\nto those used in the analyses. Manufacturers provide these calibration plates for any wavelength the equipment uses. \\nCalibration plates are equipped with at least three pre-\\nestablished optic density values within the measurement ranges; low, medium, and high value. In order to perform the calibration, follow this process:1. Place the calibration plate on the equipment. 2. Carry out a complete reading with the calibration plate. \\nVerify if there are diff  erences in the readings obtained \\nfrom well to well. If this is the case, invert the plate (180\u00b0) and repeat the reading to rule out that diff  erences are \\nattributed to the plate itself. In general, it is accepted that the instrument does not need further calibration if the plate results are as expected at two wavelengths. \\n3. Verify if the reader requires calibration. If so, proceed \\nwith the calibration following the routine outlined by the manufacturer, verifying that the reading\u2019s linearity is maintained as rigorously as possible. \\n4. If the instrument does not have a calibration plate, verify \\nit by placing a coloured solution in the wells of a plate and immediately carry out a complete reading. Then invert the plate 180\u00b0 and read the plate again. If both readings display identical, average values in each row, the reader is calibrated. 5. Verify that the reader is calibrated, column by column. \\nPlace a clean, empty plate and carry out a reading. If there is no diff  erence between each of the average \\nreading of the fi  rst to the last column, it can be assumed \\nthat the reader is calibrated.\\nROUTINE MAINTENANCE \\nMaintenance described next focuses exclusively on the micr oplate reader. The maintenance of the microplate \\nwasher is described in Chapter 2.\\nBasic maintenance \\nFrequency: Daily1. Review that optical sensors of each channel are clean. \\nIf dirt is detected, clean the surface of the windows of the light emitters and the sensors with a small brush.\\n2. Confi  rm that the lighting system is clean.\\n3. Verify that the reader\u2019s calibration is adequate. When \\nthe daily operations begin, let the reader warm up for 30 minutes. Next, do a blank reading and then read a full plate of substrate. The readings must be identical. If not, invert the plate and repeat the reading in order to determine if the deviation originated in the plate or the reader.\\n4. Examine the automatic drawer sliding system. It must \\nbe smooth and constant.\\nPreventive maintenance\\nFrequency: Quarterly1. Verify the stability of the lamp. Use the calibration plate, \\nconducting readings with intervals of 30 minutes with the same plate. Compare readings. There must be no diff erences. \\n2.

This equipment, provided \\nit is carefully used and calibrated, measures the acidity of an aqueous solution. pH meters are sometimes called pH analysers, pH monitors or potentiometers. \\nPURPOSE OF THE EQUIPMENT\\nThe pH meter is commonly used in any fi  eld of science \\nrelated to aqueous solutions. It is used in areas such as agriculture, water treatment and purifi  cation, in industrial \\nprocesses such as petrochemicals, paper manufacture, foods, pharmaceuticals, research and development, metal mechanics, etc. In the health laboratory, its applications are related to the control of culture mediums and to the measurement of the alkalinity or acidity of broths and buff ers. In specialized laboratories, diagnostic equipment \\nmicroelectrodes are used to measure the pH of liquid blood components. The plasma pH allows the patient\u2019s health to be evaluated. It normally measures between 7.35 and 7.45. This value relates to the patient\u2019s metabolism in which a multitude of reactions occurs where acids and bases are normally kept in balance. Acids constantly liberate hydrogen ions [H\\n+] and the organism neutralizes or balances \\nacidity by liberating bicarbonate ions [HCO3\u2013].

This equipment, provided \\nit is carefully used and calibrated, measures the acidity of an aqueous solution. pH meters are sometimes called pH analysers, pH monitors or potentiometers. \\nPURPOSE OF THE EQUIPMENT\\nThe pH meter is commonly used in any fi  eld of science \\nrelated to aqueous solutions. It is used in areas such as agriculture, water treatment and purifi  cation, in industrial \\nprocesses such as petrochemicals, paper manufacture, foods, pharmaceuticals, research and development, metal mechanics, etc. In the health laboratory, its applications are related to the control of culture mediums and to the measurement of the alkalinity or acidity of broths and buff ers. In specialized laboratories, diagnostic equipment \\nmicroelectrodes are used to measure the pH of liquid blood components. The plasma pH allows the patient\u2019s health to be evaluated. It normally measures between 7.35 and 7.45. This value relates to the patient\u2019s metabolism in which a multitude of reactions occurs where acids and bases are normally kept in balance. Acids constantly liberate hydrogen ions [H\\n+] and the organism neutralizes or balances \\nacidity by liberating bicarbonate ions [HCO3\u2013]. The acid-base \\nratio in the organism is maintained by the kidneys, (organs in which any excesses present are eliminated). The plasma pH is one of the characteristics that vary with factors such as age or state of health of the patient. Table 1 shows typical pH values of some bodily fl  uids.PHOTOGRAPH AND COMPONENTS OF THE \\npH METER\\nOPERA TION PRINCIPLES\\nThe pH meter measures the concentration of hydrogen ions \\n[H+] using an ion-sensitive electrode. Under ideal conditions, \\nthis electrode should respond in the presence of only one type of ion. In reality, there are always interactions or interferences with other types of ions present in the solution. A pH electrode is generally a combined electrode, in which a reference electrode and an internal glass electrode are integrated into a combined probe. The lower part of the probe ends in a round bulb of thin glass where the tip of the internal electrode is found.

The tip of the reference electrode\u2019s cathode is inside the body of the probe. On the outside and end of the inner tube is the anodized end. The reference electrode is usually made of the same type of material as the internal electrode. Both tubes, interior and exterior, contain a reference solution. Only the outer tube has contact with the measured solution through a porous cap which acts as a saline bridge.\\nThis device acts like a galvanized cell. The reference electrode \\nis the internal tube of the pH meter probe, which cannot lose ions through interactions with the surrounding environment. Therefore as a reference, it remains static (unchangeable) during the measuring process. The external tube of the probe contains the medium which is allowed  to mix with the external environment. As a result, this tube must be fi lled periodically with a potassium chloride solution (KCI) \\nfor restoring the capacity of the electrode which would otherwise be inhibited by a loss of ions and evaporation. \\nThe glass bulb on the lower part of the pH electrode acts \\nas a measuring element and is covered with a layer of hydrated gel on its exterior and interior. Metallic sodium cations [Na\\n+] are diff  used in the hydrated gel outside of \\nthe glass and in the solution, while the hydrogen ions [H+] \\nare diff  used in the gel. This gel makes the pH electrode \\nion-selective:  Hydrogen ions [H+] cannot pass through the \\nglass membrane of the pH electrode. Sodium ions [Na+] pass \\nthrough and cause a change in free energy, which the pH meter measures. A brief explanation of the theory on how electrodes function is included in the appendix at the end of the chapter.pH METER COMPONENTS \\nA pH meter generally has the following components: 1. The body of the instrument containing the circuits, \\ncontrols, connectors, display screens and measuring scales.  The following are among some of its most \\nimportant components:\\na) An ON and OFF switch.  Not all pH meters have an \\non and off   switch. Some simply have a cord with a \\nplug which allows it to be connected to a suitable electrical outlet.\\nb) Temperature control.  This control allows \\nadjustments according to the temperature of the solution measured.\\nc) Calibration controls.  Depending on the design, \\npH meters possess one or two calibration buttons or dials. Normally these are identifi  ed by Cal 1  and \\nCal 2 . If the pH meter is calibrated using only one \\nsolution, the Cal 1 button is used; making sure that Cal 2 is set at a 100%. If the pH meter allows  two point calibrations, two known pH solutions covering the range of pH to be measured are used. In this case, the two controls are used (Cal 1 and Cal 2). In special cases, a three-point calibration must be done (using three known pH solutions).\\nd) Mode selector.  The functions generally included \\nin this control are:I. Standby mode (0).  In this position the electrodes \\nare protected from electrical currents. It is the position used for maintaining the equipment while stored. \\nII. pH mode.  In this position the equipment can \\ntake pH measurements after performing the required calibration procedures.\\n4KCI KCIHigh Impedance\\nVoltmeter\\nTemperature\\nRegulator\\nReference\\nTerminal\\nSaline Mesh BridgeSolution Under AnalysisSpecial Glass Permeable to IonsActive TermimalAg\/AgCI ElectrodeFigure 4.

{"question":"What is the primary purpose of laboratory balances?","context":"['Title: data.pdfMAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\\n21Chapter 4\\nBalances\\nThe balance is an instrument which measures the mass of \\na body or substance using the gravity force which acts on that body. The word comes from the Latin terms bis which means two and lanx , plate. The balance has other names \\nsuch as scale and weight. It must be taken into account that the weight is the force which the gravitational fi  eld exercises on a body\u2019s mass, this force being the product of the mass \\nby the local acceleration of gravity [F = m x g]. The term local is used to emphasize that this acceleration depends on factors such as the geographical latitude, altitude and the Earth\u2019s density where the measurement is taken. This force is measured in Newtons.\\nGMDN Code 10261 10263 45513 46548\\nECRI Code 10-261 10-263 18-449 18-451\\nDenomination Balances Electronic balances Analytical electronic \\nbalancesMicro analytical, \\nmicroelectronic balances\\nPhoto courtesy of Acculab CorporationPhoto courtesy of Ohaus Corporation\\nPhoto courtesy o f Ohaus Corporatio n\\nPHOTOGRAPHS OF BALANCES\\nMechanical balance Electronic balance', 'Title: data.pdfCHAPTER 4  BALANCES\\n22PURPOSE OF THE BALANCE\\nThe balance is used for measuring the mass of a body or \\nsubstanc e or its weight. In the laboratory, the balance is used \\nfor weighing as part of quality control activities (on devices like pipettes), in the preparation of mixtures of components in predefined proportions and in the determination of specifi  c densities or weights.\\nOPERATION PRINCIPLES\\nThere are diff  erences in design, principles and criteria of \\nmetrology amongst balances. At present, there are two large groups of balances: mechanical and electronic balances. \\nMechanical balances \\nThe following are some of the more common ones: 1. Spring balance.  Its function is based on a mechanical \\nproperty of springs as the force exercised on a spring is proportional to the spring\u2019s elasticity constant [k], multiplied by its elongation [x] [F = -kx]. The greater the mass [m] placed on the balance\u2019s plate, the greater the elongation will be, given that the elongation is proportional to the mass and the spring\u2019s constant. The calibration of a spring balance depends on the force of gravity acting on the object weighed. This type of balance is used when great precision is not necessary.\\n2. Sliding weight balance.  This type of balance is \\nequipped with two known weights which can be moved on setting scales (one macro, the other micro). Upon placing a substance of unknown mass on the tray, its weight is determined by moving the weight on both setting scales until the equilibrium position is reached. At this point, the weight is obtained by adding both quantities indicated by the sliding masses\u2019 position on the scale. \\n3. Analytical balance.  This balance functions by comparing \\nknown weight masses with that of a substance of unknown weight. It is composed of a base on a bar or symmetrical lever, maintained by a blade-like support on a central point called a fulcrum. At its ends, there are stirrups, also supported with blades which allow these to oscillate smoothly. From there, two plates are suspended. Certifi  ed weights are placed on one \\nof the plates and unknown weights on the other. The balance has a securing system or lock, which allows the main lever to remain stable when not in use or when it is necessary to modify the counter-weights. The balance is inside an external box which protects it from interferences, such as air currents. Analytical balances can weigh ten thousandths of a gram (0.0001 g) or 100 thousandths of a gram (0.00001 g). This type of balance generally has a capacity of up to 200 grams. \\nXSpring Without Load\\nDisplacement\\nMeasuring Scale\\nMass\\nF=mgF=-kxSpring With Load\\nm\\nF = F1\\n-kx = mgFigure 7.

The set is \\ngenerally composed of the following pieces:\\n4. Upper plate balance (Top loading or parallel guidance \\nbalance).  This type of balance has a loading plate located \\non its upper part, supported by a column maintained in a vertical position by two pairs of guides with fl  exible \\nconnections. The eff  ect of the force produced by the \\nmass is transmitted from a point on the vertical column directly or by some mechanical means to the loading cell. The requirement with this type of mechanism is that parallel guides must be maintained with exactitude of up to \u00b1 1  \u00b5m. Deviations in parallelism cause an error known \\nas lateral load (when the mass being weighed shows diff erences if the reading is taken at the centre of the \\nplate or on one of its sides). The diagram shown below explains the operation principle some manufacturers have introduced in electronic balances.\\n5. Substitution Balance (Unequal-lever arm or two-\\nknife balance).  This is a balance with a single plate. \\nAn unknown mass is placed on the weighing plate. It is weighed by removing known masses from the counterweight side until it reaches a balanced position, using a mechanical system of cams. The fulcrum is generally off  -centre in relation to the length of the load \\nbeam and located near the front of the balance. When a mass is placed on the weight plate and the balance\u2019s locking mechanism is released, the movement of the load beam is projected through an optical system to a screen located on the front part of the instrument.\\nOperation veri\ufb01  cation\\nThe procedure used for verifying the functioning of a typical \\nmechanical balanc e is described below. The described \\nprocess is based on the substitution balance.1. Verify that the balance is levelled. The levelling is \\nachieved using a ring-shaped adjustment mechanism located on the base of the balance or by adjusting a bubble or knob on a scale located on the front of the balance\u2019s base.\\n2. Test the  zero mechanism. Place the controls on zero \\nand free the balance. If the reading does not stay at zero, adjust the zero mechanism (a grooved screw located in a horizontal position near the fulcrum). To do this, it is necessary to block the balance and slightly adjust the mechanism. The process is to be continued until the zero adjusts correctly on the reading scale.3. Verify and adjust the sensitivity. This is always readjusted \\nwhenever some internal adjustment is done. It is performed with a known standard according to the following steps:\\na) Lock the balance.b) Place a standard weight (equivalent to the optical \\nscale range) on the plate. \\nc) Position the micro setting to one (1). d) Release the balance. e) Adjust to the zero position.f) Position the micro setting to zero (0). The balance \\nshould indicate 100. If the scale displays less or more than 100, the sensitivity control must be adjusted. This requires locking the balance, opening the upper cover and turning the sensitivity screw: If the scale registers more than 100; turn the screw in a clockwise position. If the scale registers less than 100, it is necessary to unwind the screw anticlockwise.

The mobile parts (weighing plate, support \\ncolumn [a], bobbin, position and load indicator [G] -the object in the process of being weighed-) are maintained in equilibrium by a compensation force [F] equal to the weight. The compensation force is generated by an electrical current through a bobbin in the air gap of a cylindrical electromagnet. The force F is calculated with the equation [F = I x L x B] where: I = electrical intensity, L = total length of the wire of the coil and B = magnetic fl  ow intensity in the \\nelectromagnet\u2019s air gap.With any change in the load (weight\/mass), the mobile \\nmechanical system responds by moving vertically a fraction of distance.

At present, there are two large groups of balances: mechanical and electronic balances. \\nMechanical balances \\nThe following are some of the more common ones: 1. Spring balance.  Its function is based on a mechanical \\nproperty of springs as the force exercised on a spring is proportional to the spring\u2019s elasticity constant [k], multiplied by its elongation [x] [F = -kx]. The greater the mass [m] placed on the balance\u2019s plate, the greater the elongation will be, given that the elongation is proportional to the mass and the spring\u2019s constant. The calibration of a spring balance depends on the force of gravity acting on the object weighed. This type of balance is used when great precision is not necessary.\\n2. Sliding weight balance.  This type of balance is \\nequipped with two known weights which can be moved on setting scales (one macro, the other micro). Upon placing a substance of unknown mass on the tray, its weight is determined by moving the weight on both setting scales until the equilibrium position is reached. At this point, the weight is obtained by adding both quantities indicated by the sliding masses\u2019 position on the scale. \\n3. Analytical balance.  This balance functions by comparing \\nknown weight masses with that of a substance of unknown weight. It is composed of a base on a bar or symmetrical lever, maintained by a blade-like support on a central point called a fulcrum. At its ends, there are stirrups, also supported with blades which allow these to oscillate smoothly. From there, two plates are suspended. Certifi  ed weights are placed on one \\nof the plates and unknown weights on the other. The balance has a securing system or lock, which allows the main lever to remain stable when not in use or when it is necessary to modify the counter-weights. The balance is inside an external box which protects it from interferences, such as air currents. Analytical balances can weigh ten thousandths of a gram (0.0001 g) or 100 thousandths of a gram (0.00001 g). This type of balance generally has a capacity of up to 200 grams. \\nXSpring Without Load\\nDisplacement\\nMeasuring Scale\\nMass\\nF=mgF=-kxSpring With Load\\nm\\nF = F1\\n-kx = mgFigure 7.

Clean the weighing plate so that it is kept free of dust. \\nCleaning is done b y using a piece of clean cloth which \\nmay be dampened with distilled water.

The set is \\ngenerally composed of the following pieces:\\n4. Upper plate balance (Top loading or parallel guidance \\nbalance).  This type of balance has a loading plate located \\non its upper part, supported by a column maintained in a vertical position by two pairs of guides with fl  exible \\nconnections. The eff  ect of the force produced by the \\nmass is transmitted from a point on the vertical column directly or by some mechanical means to the loading cell. The requirement with this type of mechanism is that parallel guides must be maintained with exactitude of up to \u00b1 1  \u00b5m. Deviations in parallelism cause an error known \\nas lateral load (when the mass being weighed shows diff erences if the reading is taken at the centre of the \\nplate or on one of its sides). The diagram shown below explains the operation principle some manufacturers have introduced in electronic balances.\\n5. Substitution Balance (Unequal-lever arm or two-\\nknife balance).  This is a balance with a single plate. \\nAn unknown mass is placed on the weighing plate. It is weighed by removing known masses from the counterweight side until it reaches a balanced position, using a mechanical system of cams. The fulcrum is generally off  -centre in relation to the length of the load \\nbeam and located near the front of the balance. When a mass is placed on the weight plate and the balance\u2019s locking mechanism is released, the movement of the load beam is projected through an optical system to a screen located on the front part of the instrument.\\nOperation veri\ufb01  cation\\nThe procedure used for verifying the functioning of a typical \\nmechanical balanc e is described below. The described \\nprocess is based on the substitution balance.1. Verify that the balance is levelled. The levelling is \\nachieved using a ring-shaped adjustment mechanism located on the base of the balance or by adjusting a bubble or knob on a scale located on the front of the balance\u2019s base.\\n2. Test the  zero mechanism. Place the controls on zero \\nand free the balance. If the reading does not stay at zero, adjust the zero mechanism (a grooved screw located in a horizontal position near the fulcrum). To do this, it is necessary to block the balance and slightly adjust the mechanism. The process is to be continued until the zero adjusts correctly on the reading scale.3. Verify and adjust the sensitivity. This is always readjusted \\nwhenever some internal adjustment is done. It is performed with a known standard according to the following steps:\\na) Lock the balance.b) Place a standard weight (equivalent to the optical \\nscale range) on the plate. \\nc) Position the micro setting to one (1). d) Release the balance. e) Adjust to the zero position.f) Position the micro setting to zero (0). The balance \\nshould indicate 100. If the scale displays less or more than 100, the sensitivity control must be adjusted. This requires locking the balance, opening the upper cover and turning the sensitivity screw: If the scale registers more than 100; turn the screw in a clockwise position. If the scale registers less than 100, it is necessary to unwind the screw anticlockwise. Repeat the process until the balance is adjusted (adjusting the zero and the sensitivity).Type of mass Capacity\\nSimple pieces \\n 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 g \\n100, 200 and 500 g \\nFractional pieces \\n 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 mg \\n100, 200 and 500 mg \\nMass\\nPlate\\nFlexible\\nConnections\\nSupport ColumnFGFigure 10.

A platform of high \\ninertia, isolated from the structures located in its vicinity is ideal to reduce the eff  ect of vibrations from certain \\nequipment such as centrifuges and refrigerators. There must be a large enough area for installing the balance and any auxiliary equipment needed during the weighing processes.

The mobile parts (weighing plate, support \\ncolumn [a], bobbin, position and load indicator [G] -the object in the process of being weighed-) are maintained in equilibrium by a compensation force [F] equal to the weight. The compensation force is generated by an electrical current through a bobbin in the air gap of a cylindrical electromagnet. The force F is calculated with the equation [F = I x L x B] where: I = electrical intensity, L = total length of the wire of the coil and B = magnetic fl  ow intensity in the \\nelectromagnet\u2019s air gap.With any change in the load (weight\/mass), the mobile \\nmechanical system responds by moving vertically a fraction of distance.

A platform of high \\ninertia, isolated from the structures located in its vicinity is ideal to reduce the eff  ect of vibrations from certain \\nequipment such as centrifuges and refrigerators.

Avoid installing equipment which produces elevated \\nmagnetic fi  elds or vibrations like centrifuges, electrical \\nmotors, compressors and generators in its vicinity.\\n4. Avoid locating it directly under the air-conditioning \\nsystem (air currents) and sunlight.\\n5. An electrical outlet which complies with the current \\nelectrical standards in the country or the laboratory. It must be in good condition and equipped with a ground pole and switches.Electronic balance operation\\nThe operation of a modern electronic balance is clearly detailed in its operat or\u2019s manual from the manufacturer. In \\ngeneral, it must conform to the following procedure:1. Allow the balance to equilibrate with the environment \\nwhere it is installed. \\n2. Allow the balance to warm-up before initiating activities. \\nNormally it is suffi   cient to have it connected to the \\nelectrical feed system. Some manufacturers suggest at least 20 minutes from the moment it is energized until use. Analytical balances Class 1 require at least 2 hours for warming before initiating use. \\nVerify that the balance is calibrated. Electronic \\nbalances generally have a factory-made calibration stored in memory which can be used if it does not have calibration masses. If calibration is required, use calibrated masses as indicated by the manufacturer. The calibrated masses must conform or exceed the ASTM tolerances.

In the laboratory, the balance is used \\nfor weighing as part of quality control activities (on devices like pipettes), in the preparation of mixtures of components in predefined proportions and in the determination of specifi  c densities or weights.\\nOPERATION PRINCIPLES\\nThere are diff  erences in design, principles and criteria of \\nmetrology amongst balances. At present, there are two large groups of balances: mechanical and electronic balances. \\nMechanical balances \\nThe following are some of the more common ones: 1. Spring balance.  Its function is based on a mechanical \\nproperty of springs as the force exercised on a spring is proportional to the spring\u2019s elasticity constant [k], multiplied by its elongation [x] [F = -kx]. The greater the mass [m] placed on the balance\u2019s plate, the greater the elongation will be, given that the elongation is proportional to the mass and the spring\u2019s constant. The calibration of a spring balance depends on the force of gravity acting on the object weighed. This type of balance is used when great precision is not necessary.\\n2. Sliding weight balance.  This type of balance is \\nequipped with two known weights which can be moved on setting scales (one macro, the other micro).

This balance functions by comparing \\nknown weight masses with that of a substance of unknown weight. It is composed of a base on a bar or symmetrical lever, maintained by a blade-like support on a central point called a fulcrum. At its ends, there are stirrups, also supported with blades which allow these to oscillate smoothly. From there, two plates are suspended. Certifi  ed weights are placed on one \\nof the plates and unknown weights on the other. The balance has a securing system or lock, which allows the main lever to remain stable when not in use or when it is necessary to modify the counter-weights. The balance is inside an external box which protects it from interferences, such as air currents. Analytical balances can weigh ten thousandths of a gram (0.0001 g) or 100 thousandths of a gram (0.00001 g).

The word comes from the Latin terms bis which means two and lanx , plate. The balance has other names \\nsuch as scale and weight. It must be taken into account that the weight is the force which the gravitational fi  eld exercises on a body\u2019s mass, this force being the product of the mass \\nby the local acceleration of gravity [F = m x g]. The term local is used to emphasize that this acceleration depends on factors such as the geographical latitude, altitude and the Earth\u2019s density where the measurement is taken. This force is measured in Newtons.\\nGMDN Code 10261 10263 45513 46548\\nECRI Code 10-261 10-263 18-449 18-451\\nDenomination Balances Electronic balances Analytical electronic \\nbalancesMicro analytical, \\nmicroelectronic balances\\nPhoto courtesy of Acculab CorporationPhoto courtesy of Ohaus Corporation\\nPhoto courtesy o f Ohaus Corporatio n\\nPHOTOGRAPHS OF BALANCES\\nMechanical balance Electronic balance', 'Title: data.pdfCHAPTER 4  BALANCES\\n22PURPOSE OF THE BALANCE\\nThe balance is used for measuring the mass of a body or \\nsubstanc e or its weight. In the laboratory, the balance is used \\nfor weighing as part of quality control activities (on devices like pipettes), in the preparation of mixtures of components in predefined proportions and in the determination of specifi  c densities or weights.\\nOPERATION PRINCIPLES\\nThere are diff  erences in design, principles and criteria of \\nmetrology amongst balances. At present, there are two large groups of balances: mechanical and electronic balances. \\nMechanical balances \\nThe following are some of the more common ones: 1. Spring balance.  Its function is based on a mechanical \\nproperty of springs as the force exercised on a spring is proportional to the spring\u2019s elasticity constant [k], multiplied by its elongation [x] [F = -kx]. The greater the mass [m] placed on the balance\u2019s plate, the greater the elongation will be, given that the elongation is proportional to the mass and the spring\u2019s constant. The calibration of a spring balance depends on the force of gravity acting on the object weighed. This type of balance is used when great precision is not necessary.\\n2. Sliding weight balance.  This type of balance is \\nequipped with two known weights which can be moved on setting scales (one macro, the other micro). Upon placing a substance of unknown mass on the tray, its weight is determined by moving the weight on both setting scales until the equilibrium position is reached. At this point, the weight is obtained by adding both quantities indicated by the sliding masses\u2019 position on the scale. \\n3. Analytical balance.

The \\noutlet must ha ve its respective ground pole in order \\nto guarantee the protection and safety of the operator and the equipment. Water baths generally operate at 120 V\/60 Hz or 230 V\/60Hz. Its installation and use is facilitated by a sink close by for supplying and draining of water. \\n2. Verify that the location selected is levelled and has the \\nnecessary resistance to safely support the weight of the water bath when it is full of liquid.\\n3. Ensure that the location has a suitable amount of space \\nfor putting the samples and the accessories required for the normal operation of the water bath.\\n4. Avoid placing the water bath where there are strong air \\ncurrents which can interfere with its normal operation. For example: in front of an air-conditioning unit or window.\\nSafety\\n1. Avoid the use of the water bath in environments where \\nther e are fl  ammable and combustible materials.

Always connect the equipment to an electrical outlet \\nwith a ground pole to protect the user and the equipment from electrical discharges. The electrical connection must comply with the required norms of the country and the laboratory.\\n3. Use the water bath exclusively with non-corrosive or \\nnon-fl  ammable liquids.\\n4. Use personal protective elements when working with \\nthe water bath. The bath has resistors which can cause burns if inadvertently touched, even a considerable time after turning off   the equipment. \\n5. When working with substances that generate vapours, \\nplace the water bath under a chemical hood or in a well ventilated area.\\n6. Remember that liquids incubated in the water bath tank \\ncan produce burns if hands are inadvertently placed inside it.\\n7. Take into account that the water bath is designed for \\nuse with a liquid inside the tank. If the inside is dry, the temperature of the tank can become very high. Use the diff  using tray for placing the container inside of the \\nfi lled tank of the water bath. This has been designed for \\ndistributing the temperature in a uniform way.\\n8.

The \\ncentrifuge is designed to use the centrifugal force generated in rotational movements to separate the constitutive elements of a mixture. There is a wide range of centrifuges capable of serving specifi  c industry and research needs. This \\nchapter focuses on standing centrifuges normally used in public health and clinical laboratories.\\nPHOTOGRAPH OF CENTRIFUGEPURPOSE OF THE CENTRIFUGE\\nThe centrifuge uses centrifugal force (the force generated \\nwhen an objec t rotates around a single point), for separating \\nsolids suspended in a liquid by sedimentation, or liquids of diverse density. The rotational movements allow forces much greater than gravity to be generated in controlled periods of time.

Information on the compatibility of the rotor with other \\nmodels of centrifuges from the same manufacturer.\\nRecently manufactured centrifuges have incorporated \\nnumerous improvements into their design to provide greater safety and longer operational life. Among advances mentioned are controls based on microprocessors. By means of software  controlled by a keyboard, these have several \\ndiff erent operational programs in memory. According to the \\ntype of rotor being used and procedure conducted, these programs control the centrifugation time, the required temperature, the rotor\u2019s revolutions, the acceleration and deceleration, alarms warning the operator about any anomaly during operation.\\nManufacturers have also incorporated induction motors \\n(without brushes) in centrifuges. These have the advantage of electronically controlling currents and magnetic fields regulating the rotor\u2019s speed which reduces the frequency of maintenance. Operation and maintenance of such equipment must be carried out according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations.\\nINSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS\\nCentrifuges require the following for normal operation:1. An electrical connection with a capacity suitable for the \\nequipment providing stable single phase or triphase type voltage (depending on the model and specifi  cation \\ngiven by the manufacturer). In general, centrifuges use 110V or 220 V\/60 Hz.\\n2. A clean, dust free environment with a fi  rm levelled \\nfl oor.\\n3. If the centrifuge is refrigerated, it needs a free space on \\nthe side of the condenser for adequate heat transfer.\\n4. A cabinet in which the centrifuge accessories such as \\nthe alternate rotors can be kept. \\nROUTINE MAINTENANCE\\nThe routine maintenance required by a centrifuge depends on multiple fac tors such as the incorporated technology, \\nusage intensity, training of users, quality of the electrical feed and environmental conditions. The following are general recommendations regarding adequate use and most common maintenance for guaranteeing correct operation. The routines or specialized repairs will depend on manufacturers\u2019 recommendations for each brand and model. Always disinfect the rotor bowl, centrifuge head, buckets and trunnion rings as applicable before any servicing of centrifuges used to prepare clinical or infectious samples.\\nPriority recommendation. Verify that only qualifi  ed personnel \\ntrained and familiar with the use, care, risks and handling of the centrifuge operates it.

The \\ncentrifuge is designed to use the centrifugal force generated in rotational movements to separate the constitutive elements of a mixture. There is a wide range of centrifuges capable of serving specifi  c industry and research needs. This \\nchapter focuses on standing centrifuges normally used in public health and clinical laboratories.\\nPHOTOGRAPH OF CENTRIFUGEPURPOSE OF THE CENTRIFUGE\\nThe centrifuge uses centrifugal force (the force generated \\nwhen an objec t rotates around a single point), for separating \\nsolids suspended in a liquid by sedimentation, or liquids of diverse density. The rotational movements allow forces much greater than gravity to be generated in controlled periods of time. In the laboratory, centrifuges are generally used in processes such as the separation of solid components from biological liquids through sedimentation and in particular of blood components: red cells, white cells, platelets among others and for conducting multiple tests and treatments.There are several kinds of centrifuges. The most widely used in public health, surveillance and clinical laboratories are the table-top centrifuge, the ultracentrifuge, the haeamatocrit centrifuge and the standing centrifuge.\\nOPERATION PRINCIPLES \\nCentrifuges represent a practical application of Newton\u2019s law of motion. When a body of mass [m] turns around \\na central point [O], it is subjected to a centripetal  force \\n[N] directed towards the rotation axis with a magnitude N = m\u03c9\\n2R, where [m] is the mass of the body, [R] is the radius \\nand \u03c9 is the angular speed. Centrifuges possess a rotating axis on which is mounted a rotor with sample receiving compartments. Tangential speed is defi  ned by the following \\nequation: VT=\u03c9R.\\nPhoto courtesy of Beckman Coulter']","response":"When using a centrifuge, the following safety precautions should be taken:\n\n1. **Use a shield** if working with radioactive material (Source: data.pdf).\n2. **Load or unload rotors inside a biological safety cabinet** if working with materials classified as Biosafety level II or higher (Source: data.pdf).\n3. **Never try to open the cover of a centrifuge while it is functioning** and never try to stop the rotor by hand (Source: data.pdf).\n4. **Verify the locking\/safety mechanism of the centrifuge\u2019s cover** to ensure it remains closed while the rotor is turning (Source: data.pdf).\n5. **Avoid spilling liquids on control keys** and operate them with fingertips to prevent damage (Source: data.pdf).\n\nThese precautions help ensure the safety of the operator and the proper functioning of the centrifuge.","ground_truth":"Safety precautions include balancing samples properly, securing the lid before starting, avoiding overloading, and using appropriate PPE."}

A laboratory area protected from air currents from \\nwindows or air-conditioning systems. The cabinet must also be located far from the laboratory circulation zones in order to avoid air currents that could affect the curtain of air inside the cabinet. It must also be verifi  ed \\nthat the cabinet is not installed alongside other types of cabinets such as chemical hoods.\\n2. An electrical connection equipped with the respective \\ncontrol and safety elements; the electrical outlet with a ground pole.\\n3. A levelled and fi  rm table designed for supporting the \\nweight of the cabinet and allowing the operator to work comfortably. There must be free space for placing the feet and its height must be adequate.4. The floor on which it is located must be flat and \\nlevelled.\\n5. The free space around the cabinet recommended by the \\nmanufacturer must be respected. Likewise, the height of the room must be verifi  ed (the ceiling must be of \\nrecommended height so that it can function without hindrance). \\n6. Type B cabinets must have an extraction duct equipped \\nwith the following required control devices: regulating valves that allow the flow of air to be isolated and regulated.\\n7. Gas connections must be in the immediate vicinity of \\nthe cabinet in order to facilitate the connection to these service valves.\\n8. The cabinet must be certifi  ed annually to verify that it \\ncomplies with the established requirements in the NSF 49 Regulation.\\nUSE OF THE SAFETY CABINET\\nCorrect utilization of the biological safety cabinet is achieved by complying with the following instructions:\\n1.

{"question":"What is the purpose of a water distiller in a laboratory?","context":"['Title: data.pdfMAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\\n53Chapter 8\\nWater Distiller\\nThe word distiller  comes from the Latin word distillare  \\nwhich means to vaporize liquids through heat. The water distiller, also called distillation unit or water still, used in the laboratory, purifi  es running water by means of controlled \\nvaporization and cooling processes. Upon applying thermal energy to water in a liquid phase by a warming process, it is changed into vapour. This allows the water molecules to separate from the molecules of other substances mixed or diluted. The water vapour is collected and passed through a condenser, where it is cooled and returned to the liquid phase. Then, the condensed water is collected into a diff  erent storage tank. Distilled water shows pure \\ncharacteristics compared to running water; it is practically free of contaminating substances.PURPOSE OF THE WATER DISTILLER\\nThe water distiller facilitates obtaining very pure water from potable wat er normally provided by the aqueduct services \\nin urban centres. Distilled water is characterized by a lack of solids in suspension. It is used in multiple applications in centres which provide health services, especially in laboratory units, in washing, sterilization and dietetics. The more specialized the procedures are in the laboratory, the greater will be the level of purity required. For example: the preparation of reagents or biological material requires water of the highest quality. Distillation is one of the fundamental processes to achieve this (although it may not be the only one required).

The water distiller, also called distillation unit or water still, used in the laboratory, purifi  es running water by means of controlled \\nvaporization and cooling processes. Upon applying thermal energy to water in a liquid phase by a warming process, it is changed into vapour. This allows the water molecules to separate from the molecules of other substances mixed or diluted. The water vapour is collected and passed through a condenser, where it is cooled and returned to the liquid phase. Then, the condensed water is collected into a diff  erent storage tank. Distilled water shows pure \\ncharacteristics compared to running water; it is practically free of contaminating substances.PURPOSE OF THE WATER DISTILLER\\nThe water distiller facilitates obtaining very pure water from potable wat er normally provided by the aqueduct services \\nin urban centres. Distilled water is characterized by a lack of solids in suspension. It is used in multiple applications in centres which provide health services, especially in laboratory units, in washing, sterilization and dietetics. The more specialized the procedures are in the laboratory, the greater will be the level of purity required. For example: the preparation of reagents or biological material requires water of the highest quality. Distillation is one of the fundamental processes to achieve this (although it may not be the only one required).

The configuration and design vary \\ndepending on the volume of water required. The following is a general explanation of the components of a distiller and a description of how these function. 1. Vapour generator.  Also known as the boiling tank, \\nthis component is the container where the water to be distilled is stored. In general, it has a hydraulic connection which allows the water evaporated and distilled to be replenished. It is generally made of glass in small distillers or of stainless steel with copper, tin or titanium coverings in large capacity machines. It can have level, fl  ow and water quality feed controls, which \\nprotect the distiller in case some irregularity in the water supply occurs. As a source of energy, it uses the water vapour coming from a boiler or vapour generator, or the thermal energy from electrical immersion resistors through direct conduction. These cause the water temperature to rise until, in normal conditions (atmospheric pressure equal to an atmosphere and gravity acceleration equal to 9.80665 m\/s\\n2) water in the \\nliquid phase is transformed into vapour at 100 \u00b0C.\\n2. Water level.  Device which allows the quantity of water \\nto be regulated inside the vapour generator. It is joined directly to the connection which supplies the water used by the distiller. When the quantity of water in liquid phase contained in the boiling tank decreases, the device allows the quantity of liquid evaporated to be recovered.\\n3. Control valve.  Mechanical or electromechanical device \\nwhich allows the fl  ow of water towards the vapour generator tank to be regulated.\\n4. Hydraulic connection.  Network which supplies water \\nin liquid phase to the vapour generator tank.\\n5. Water in liquid phase.  Water inside the vapour generator \\ntank. It receives thermal energy from the immersion resistors and it is converted to vapour when the required temperature and pressure conditions are met.\\n6. Immersion resistors.  Devices generating heat when \\nan electrical current circulates through them. These are isolated by a ceramic cap and protected from the external environment by a metal shield.\\n7. Refrigeration water outlet. Line carrying the water \\nused for condensing the water vapour thus removing the thermal energy from it (cooling).8. Condenser.  Device in which the vapour loses thermal \\nenergy, cools and returns to its liquid phase. In order to accelerate the process, forced convection by low temperature fl  uid circulation (air or water) around the \\nline through which the vapour fl  ows is used.\\n9. Filter.  Distillers have activated carbon fi  lters located at \\nthe exit of the condenser or collector. These eliminate fl avours or particles which may be present in the vapour \\nbeing condensed.\\n10. Distilled water container.  Device in which the fl  uid \\ncompleting the distillation process is collected. Distilled water must be stored in special plastic containers to avoid ionic contamination. Polyethylene, polypropylene or polytetrafl  uoroethylene containers are generally used.\\nINSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS \\nDepending on the design, capacity and type of distiller, \\nthe r equired installation may vary. The most common \\nrequirements are the following:1. A well ventilated environment in which the equipment \\ncan be installed. This is necessary because the distiller transfers heat to a fl  uid and increases the temperature \\nof the area where it is installed. It is necessary to leave free space around the distiller so that the fl  ow of air is \\nfacilitated. Some distillers are assembled inside a metal box and need to be installed on a support to facilitate the circulation of air under them.\\n2. A potable water connection. Typically the required \\nhydraulic connection has a diameter of 1\/2\u201d . To ensure a smooth operation, the quality of the water feeding the distiller must be evaluated to determine if it is necessary to install a treatment system\\n1 to prevent the presence \\nof incrustations or sediments in the vapour generating tank and on immersion resistors. Potable water is used for feeding the vapour generator and for refrigerating the condenser\\n2.\\n3. A distilled water connection.

Distillers have activated carbon fi  lters located at \\nthe exit of the condenser or collector. These eliminate fl avours or particles which may be present in the vapour \\nbeing condensed.\\n10. Distilled water container.  Device in which the fl  uid \\ncompleting the distillation process is collected. Distilled water must be stored in special plastic containers to avoid ionic contamination. Polyethylene, polypropylene or polytetrafl  uoroethylene containers are generally used.\\nINSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS \\nDepending on the design, capacity and type of distiller, \\nthe r equired installation may vary. The most common \\nrequirements are the following:1. A well ventilated environment in which the equipment \\ncan be installed. This is necessary because the distiller transfers heat to a fl  uid and increases the temperature \\nof the area where it is installed. It is necessary to leave free space around the distiller so that the fl  ow of air is \\nfacilitated. Some distillers are assembled inside a metal box and need to be installed on a support to facilitate the circulation of air under them.\\n2. A potable water connection. Typically the required \\nhydraulic connection has a diameter of 1\/2\u201d . To ensure a smooth operation, the quality of the water feeding the distiller must be evaluated to determine if it is necessary to install a treatment system\\n1 to prevent the presence \\nof incrustations or sediments in the vapour generating tank and on immersion resistors. Potable water is used for feeding the vapour generator and for refrigerating the condenser\\n2.\\n3. A distilled water connection. The distilled water produced \\nis initially collected into a storage tank. In large capacity equipment, it is distributed', 'Title: data.pdfMAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\\n55\\n5.

The maintenance described in this manual \\nfocuses on a distiller equipped with a stainless steel vapour generator tank with immersion resistors and a condenser refrigerated through a ventilator impelling air (on or through the condenser\u2019s diff  using fi  ns). \\nWarning:  Before carrying out an inspection or routine \\nmaintenance, verify that the distiller is turned off and disconnected from the electrical source.\\nInspection and cleaning of the vapour generator tank\\nFrequency: Monthly1. Remove the protective panel or open the door allowing \\naccess to the boiling tank or vapour generator.\\n2. Remove the cover of the boiling tank.3. Visually verify if the interior walls or the immersion \\nresistors show solid deposits or sediments. The quantity of deposits present depends on the quality of water fed to the distiller. If there is an accumulation of sediments, it must be cleaned to avoid damaging the resistors\\n1.\\n4. Clean accumulated deposits. In general, the cleaning \\nprocess requires a chemical product especially designed for removing them. The product must be selected according to the characteristics of the water used. This is determined by a chemical analysis. \\n5. Drain water from the generator tank until its level is \\napproximately 10 cm above the location of the water level probe or the immersion resistance (verify that the water level is higher than the base of the tank to ensure that all of the elements stay submerged in water).\\n6.

The water distiller, also called distillation unit or water still, used in the laboratory, purifi  es running water by means of controlled \\nvaporization and cooling processes. Upon applying thermal energy to water in a liquid phase by a warming process, it is changed into vapour. This allows the water molecules to separate from the molecules of other substances mixed or diluted. The water vapour is collected and passed through a condenser, where it is cooled and returned to the liquid phase. Then, the condensed water is collected into a diff  erent storage tank. Distilled water shows pure \\ncharacteristics compared to running water; it is practically free of contaminating substances.PURPOSE OF THE WATER DISTILLER\\nThe water distiller facilitates obtaining very pure water from potable wat er normally provided by the aqueduct services \\nin urban centres. Distilled water is characterized by a lack of solids in suspension. It is used in multiple applications in centres which provide health services, especially in laboratory units, in washing, sterilization and dietetics. The more specialized the procedures are in the laboratory, the greater will be the level of purity required. For example: the preparation of reagents or biological material requires water of the highest quality. Distillation is one of the fundamental processes to achieve this (although it may not be the only one required). Water used in laboratories must be free of pyrogens, with a concentration of total solids no greater than 1 ppm, a pH value between 5.4 and 7.2 and an electrical resistance of at least 3 x 10\\n5 ohm\/cm at 25 \u00b0C1.\\n1 Warming cabinets, sterilizers, and associated equipment , Division 11\u2013 \\nEquipment, USACE\/NAVFAC\/ AFCESA, UFGS-11710, July 2003.

{"question":"What kind of maintenance is required for dispensers?","context":"['Title: data.pdfMAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\\n3INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS\\nIn order for the microplate reader to operate correctly, the \\nfollowing points need to be respected:  \\n1. A clean, dust free environment. 2. A stable work table away from equipment that vibrates \\n(centrifuges, agitators). It should be of a suitable size so that there is working space at the side of the microplate reader. The required complementary equipment for conducting the technique described above is: washer, incubator, dispenser and computer with its peripheral attachments. \\n3. An electrical supply source, which complies with the \\ncountry\u2019s norms and standards. In the countries of the Americas for example, 110 V and 60 Hertz frequencies are generally used, whereas other regions of the World use 220-240V, 50\/60HZ.\\nCalibration of the microplate reader \\nThe calibration of a microplate reader is a specialized process which must be ex ecuted by a technician or trained engineer \\nfollowing the instructions provided by each manufacturer. In order to do the calibration, it is necessary to have a set of grey fi  lters mounted on a plate of equal geometric size \\nto those used in the analyses. Manufacturers provide these calibration plates for any wavelength the equipment uses. \\nCalibration plates are equipped with at least three pre-\\nestablished optic density values within the measurement ranges; low, medium, and high value. In order to perform the calibration, follow this process:1. Place the calibration plate on the equipment. 2. Carry out a complete reading with the calibration plate. \\nVerify if there are diff  erences in the readings obtained \\nfrom well to well. If this is the case, invert the plate (180\u00b0) and repeat the reading to rule out that diff  erences are \\nattributed to the plate itself. In general, it is accepted that the instrument does not need further calibration if the plate results are as expected at two wavelengths. \\n3. Verify if the reader requires calibration. If so, proceed \\nwith the calibration following the routine outlined by the manufacturer, verifying that the reading\u2019s linearity is maintained as rigorously as possible. \\n4. If the instrument does not have a calibration plate, verify \\nit by placing a coloured solution in the wells of a plate and immediately carry out a complete reading. Then invert the plate 180\u00b0 and read the plate again. If both readings display identical, average values in each row, the reader is calibrated. 5. Verify that the reader is calibrated, column by column. \\nPlace a clean, empty plate and carry out a reading. If there is no diff  erence between each of the average \\nreading of the fi  rst to the last column, it can be assumed \\nthat the reader is calibrated.\\nROUTINE MAINTENANCE \\nMaintenance described next focuses exclusively on the micr oplate reader. The maintenance of the microplate \\nwasher is described in Chapter 2.\\nBasic maintenance \\nFrequency: Daily1. Review that optical sensors of each channel are clean. \\nIf dirt is detected, clean the surface of the windows of the light emitters and the sensors with a small brush.\\n2. Confi  rm that the lighting system is clean.\\n3. Verify that the reader\u2019s calibration is adequate. When \\nthe daily operations begin, let the reader warm up for 30 minutes. Next, do a blank reading and then read a full plate of substrate. The readings must be identical. If not, invert the plate and repeat the reading in order to determine if the deviation originated in the plate or the reader.\\n4. Examine the automatic drawer sliding system. It must \\nbe smooth and constant.\\nPreventive maintenance\\nFrequency: Quarterly1. Verify the stability of the lamp. Use the calibration plate, \\nconducting readings with intervals of 30 minutes with the same plate. Compare readings. There must be no diff erences. \\n2.

Remove the protective panel or open the door allowing \\naccess to the boiling tank or vapour generator.\\n2. Remove the cover of the boiling tank.3. Visually verify if the interior walls or the immersion \\nresistors show solid deposits or sediments. The quantity of deposits present depends on the quality of water fed to the distiller. If there is an accumulation of sediments, it must be cleaned to avoid damaging the resistors\\n1.\\n4. Clean accumulated deposits. In general, the cleaning \\nprocess requires a chemical product especially designed for removing them. The product must be selected according to the characteristics of the water used. This is determined by a chemical analysis. \\n5. Drain water from the generator tank until its level is \\napproximately 10 cm above the location of the water level probe or the immersion resistance (verify that the water level is higher than the base of the tank to ensure that all of the elements stay submerged in water).\\n6.

Place electrodes in the calibration solution.  \\n2.1 Submerge the electrode in the standardization \\nsolution in such a manner that its lower extremity does not touch the bottom of the beaker. This decreases the risk of breaking the electrode. If the test requires that the solution be kept in motion using the magnetic agitator, special care must be taken so that the agitation rod does not hit the electrode as this could break it. Buff  er solution \\nis used as a calibration solution, because its pH is known and therefore will still be maintained even if a little contamination occurs. In general, a solution of pH = 7 is used for this purpose\\n1.\\n3. Turn the functions selector from Standby position to \\npH position.  \\n3.1 T his action connects the electrode to the pH \\nmeasuring scale in the pH meter. \\n3.2 Adjust the meter to read the pH of the calibration \\nsolution using the button marked Cal 1. This enables the meter to read the pH of the calibration solution. \\n For example: For a solution at pH = 7, the needle can oscillate slightly in units of 0.1 pH; on average, the reading should be 7. The reading of the meter (reading scale) should be done perpendicularly, to avoid or eliminate parallel-type errors (reading errors produced by the shadow of the meter\u2019s needle, visible on the mirror of the reading scale). The pH meter is then ready (calibrated), to carry out the correct pH readings.\\n3.3. Put the functions selector in the Standby \\nposition.\\n4.

Register the reading obtained on the control sheet. \\n4.6 Turn the functions selector again to the Standby \\nposition.\\n If it is necessary to measure the pH of more than one solution, repeat the previously described procedures, rinsing the probe with distilled water and drying with clean, lint-free paper between readings. When the pH has to be measured in numerous solutions, the pH meter must be calibrated frequently, following the steps previously described. \\n5. Turn off the pH meter.  \\n5.1 Remove the electrode from the last solution \\nanalyzed. \\n5.2 R inse the electrode in distilled water and dry it with \\na drying material that will not penetrate it. \\n5.3 Place the electrode in its storage container. 5.4 Verify that the functions selector is in the Standby \\nposition. \\n5.5 Activate the off switch or disconnect the feed \\ncable, if it lacks this control. \\n5.6 Clean the work area. \\nGENERAL MAINTENANCE OF THE pH METER\\npH meters have two general maintenance procedures: one c oncerning the analyzer\u2019s body, the other for the pH \\ndetection probe (electrodes).   \\nGeneral maintenance procedures for the pH meter\u2019s body\\nFrequency: Every six months \\n1.

{"question":"What are the typical troubleshooting steps for dispenser malfunction?","context":"['Title: data.pdfMAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\\n61\\nDispenser system\\nThe dispenser system is composed of a set of high precision \\nsyringes and devic es called dispensers, through which \\nfl uids are supplied according to their volumes and selected \\nvelocities. These syringes are selected and installed in the dilutor depending on the densities, viscosities, and volumes of fluids to be manipulated. The fluids are transported through flexible tubes, whose diameters, lengths and chemical compatibility are taken into account in the design and manufacturing process for suitability with the selected activity. These tubes are linked using connections manually adjustable. Normally, the syringes are classifi  ed according to \\ntheir use (e.g. syringes for reagents, diluents, samples), and the volume these manipulate. The following table shows an example of how they are classifi  ed according to their size \\nand managed volumes.\\nOpposite, the components of the dispensing system (syringe \\nand dispenser) are shown.\\nINSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS\\nThe dilutor must be installed on a clean, dry and extremely levelled counter or work surface, far from areas where there \\nmay be vapours which can aff  ect its functioning. \\nThere must be free space around the equipment for \\nfacilitating ventilation and the passage of cables and interconnection lines and cables with the solvent containers, computers or supply systems. The space around the dilutor should be approximately 10 cm. \\nThere must be a 115 V, 60 Hz electrical outlet in good \\ncondition with a ground pole or alternatively one of 220\u2013240 V, 50\/60 Hz, depending on the manufacturer\u2019s specifi  cations \\nand\/or the electrical norms in the country of use.ROUTINE MAINTENANCE \\nThe routine maintenance focuses mainly on eliminating contaminants which may accumulate inside the fluid \\nmechanisms and\/or lines. The most common routines are the following:\\nCleaning of exterior surfaces\\nFrequency: Daily\\nWarning:  Disconnect the dilutor from the electrical feed \\noutlet before beginning the external cleaning process.\\n1. Clean the exterior surfaces using a clean piece of cloth \\ndampened with a mild detergent mixed with water.\\n2. Lightly rub the surfaces of the dilutor and the \\naccessories.\\n3.
