This information, along with good use and care, helps to maintain laboratory equipment in optimal condition.MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n1The microplate reader also known as \u201cPhotometric \nmicro-plate reader or ELISA reader\u201d is a specialized spectrophotometer designed to read results of the ELISA test, a technique used to determine the presence of antibodies or specifi  c antigens in samples. The technique \nis based on the detection of an antigen or antibodies captured on a solid surface using direct or secondary, labelled antibodies, producing a reaction whose product can be read by the spectrophotometer. The word ELISA is the acronym for \u201cEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay\u201d . This chapter covers the use of microplate readers for ELISA testing. For additional information on the instrument principles of operation and maintenance, consult Chapter 11 discussing the spectrophotometer. PHOTOGRAPH OF MICROPLATE READER\nPURPOSE OF THE MICROPLATE READER\nThe microplate reader is used for reading the results of ELISA \ntests. This technique has a direct application in immunology and serology. Among other applications it confi  rms the \npresence of antibodies or antigens of an infectious agent in an organism, antibodies from a vaccine or auto-antibodies, for example in rheumatoid arthritis.OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThe microplate reader is a specialized spectrophotometer. Unlike the c onventional spectrophotometer which facilitates \nreadings on a wide range of wavelengths, the microplate reader has filters or diffraction gratings that limit the wavelength range to that used in ELISA, generally between 400 to 750 nm (nanometres). Some readers operate in the ultraviolet range and carry out analyses between 340 to 700 nm. The optical system exploited by many manufacturers uses optic fi  bres to supply light to the microplate wells \ncontaining the samples. The light beam, passing through the sample has a diameter ranging between 1 to 3 mm. A detection system detects the light coming from the sample, amplifi  es the signal and determines the sample\u2019s \nabsorbance. A reading system converts it into data allowing the test result interpretation. Some microplate readers use double beam light systems. Test samples are located in specially designed plates with \na specifi  c number of wells where the procedure or test is \ncarried out. Plates of 8 columns by 12 rows with a total of 96 wells are common. There are also plates with a greater number of wells. For specialized applications, the current trend is to increase the number of wells (384-well plates) to reduce the amount of reagents and samples used and a greater throughput. The location of the optical sensors of the microplate reader varies depending on the manufacturers: these can be located above the sample plate, or directly underneath the plate\u2019s wells. Nowadays microplate readers have controls regulated by \nmicroprocessors; connection interfaces to information systems; quality and process control programs, which by means of a computer, allow complete test automation.Chapter 1\nMicroplate Reader\nGMDN Code 37036\nECRI Code 16-979\nDenomination Photometric micro-plate reader\nPhoto courtesy of BioRad Laboratories CHAPTER 1  MICROPLATE READER\n2Equipment required for ELISA testing\nIn order to perform the ELISA technique, the following \nequipment is r equired:  \n1.

It allows the processing \nand display of the weighing operation results. It may also allow other special functions such as piece counting, percentage weighing, dynamic weighing of unstable weight (e.g. animals), and formula weighing, among others. The calculations are done by the microprocessor following the instructions entered by the operator on the balance\u2019s keyboard.

The water distiller, also called distillation unit or water still, used in the laboratory, purifi  es running water by means of controlled \nvaporization and cooling processes. Upon applying thermal energy to water in a liquid phase by a warming process, it is changed into vapour. This allows the water molecules to separate from the molecules of other substances mixed or diluted. The water vapour is collected and passed through a condenser, where it is cooled and returned to the liquid phase. Then, the condensed water is collected into a diff  erent storage tank. Distilled water shows pure \ncharacteristics compared to running water; it is practically free of contaminating substances.PURPOSE OF THE WATER DISTILLER\nThe water distiller facilitates obtaining very pure water from potable wat er normally provided by the aqueduct services \nin urban centres. Distilled water is characterized by a lack of solids in suspension. It is used in multiple applications in centres which provide health services, especially in laboratory units, in washing, sterilization and dietetics. The more specialized the procedures are in the laboratory, the greater will be the level of purity required. For example: the preparation of reagents or biological material requires water of the highest quality. Distillation is one of the fundamental processes to achieve this (although it may not be the only one required). Water used in laboratories must be free of pyrogens, with a concentration of total solids no greater than 1 ppm, a pH value between 5.4 and 7.2 and an electrical resistance of at least 3 x 10\n5 ohm\/cm at 25 \u00b0C1. 1 Warming cabinets, sterilizers, and associated equipment , Division 11\u2013 \nEquipment, USACE\/NAVFAC\/ AFCESA, UFGS-11710, July 2003.

Device in which the fl  uid \ncompleting the distillation process is collected. Distilled water must be stored in special plastic containers to avoid ionic contamination. Polyethylene, polypropylene or polytetrafl  uoroethylene containers are generally used. INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS \nDepending on the design, capacity and type of distiller, \nthe r equired installation may vary. The most common \nrequirements are the following:1. A well ventilated environment in which the equipment \ncan be installed. This is necessary because the distiller transfers heat to a fl  uid and increases the temperature \nof the area where it is installed. It is necessary to leave free space around the distiller so that the fl  ow of air is \nfacilitated. Some distillers are assembled inside a metal box and need to be installed on a support to facilitate the circulation of air under them. 2.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>2.

Its purpose is to give a better \nunderstanding of the technical requirements regarding installation, use and maintenance of various types of equipment which play an important role in performing diagnostic testing. The manual also aims to provide support to personnel responsible for technical management, implementation of quality management and maintenance. Due to the diversity of origins, brands and models, this manual off  ers general recommendations. Equipment-specifi  c details \nare explained in depth in the maintenance and installation user manuals from manufacturers. These should be requested and ordered through the procurement processes of the individual agencies and professionals responsible for the acquisition of technology, or directly from the manufacturer. This manual was originally developed by the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) to support improved quality \nprogrammes which PAHO promotes in regional laboratories. The English version was produced by WHO to further expand support for quality programmes in other regions. The revised edition now includes 20 equipment groups selected to cover those most commonly used in low to medium technical complexity laboratories across the world. Given the diff  erences in \ntechnical complexity, brands and existing models, each chapter has been developed with basic equipment in mind, including new technology where relevant. The following information is included in each chapter: \n\u2022\u2022 Groups of equipment, organized by their generic names. Alternative names have also been included. \u2022\u2022 Photographs or diagrams, or a combination of both t o identify the type of equipment under consideration. \u2022\u2022 A brief explanation on the main uses or applications of the equipment in the laboratory. \u2022\u2022 A basic description of the principles by which the equipment operates with explanations of principles or physical and\/or \nchemical la ws which the interested reader can \u2013 or should study in depth. \u2022\u2022 Installation requirements with emphasis on the electrical aspects and the r equirements for safe installation and operation, \nincluding worldwide electrical standards. \u2022\u2022 Basic routine maintenance, classifi  ed according to the required frequency (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually \nor sporadically). The procedures are numbered and presented in the actual sequence in which these should take place (model-specifi  c procedures can be found in the manuals published by the manufacturers). \u2022\u2022 Troubleshooting tables with the most frequent problems aff  ecting the equipment with possible causes and actions that \nmay resolve these problems. \u2022\u2022 A list of basic defi  nitions of some of the specialized terms used.<\/DOCUMENT>\nWhat organization is mentioned in the context?

Recently manufactured centrifuges have incorporated \nnumerous improvements into their design to provide greater safety and longer operational life. Among advances mentioned are controls based on microprocessors. By means of software  controlled by a keyboard, these have several \ndiff erent operational programs in memory. According to the \ntype of rotor being used and procedure conducted, these programs control the centrifugation time, the required temperature, the rotor\u2019s revolutions, the acceleration and deceleration, alarms warning the operator about any anomaly during operation. Manufacturers have also incorporated induction motors \n(without brushes) in centrifuges. These have the advantage of electronically controlling currents and magnetic fields regulating the rotor\u2019s speed which reduces the frequency of maintenance. Operation and maintenance of such equipment must be carried out according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS\nCentrifuges require the following for normal operation:1. An electrical connection with a capacity suitable for the \nequipment providing stable single phase or triphase type voltage (depending on the model and specifi  cation \ngiven by the manufacturer). In general, centrifuges use 110V or 220 V\/60 Hz. 2.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Clean the system. In order to carry out cleaning, a fl  uid \nwhich complements the cleaning solution is circulated (consult the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations). It is common to use deionised water as a cleaning fl  uid. Depending on the substances processed in the dilutor, other cleaning agents can be used such as ethanol, urea, or a 10% bleach solution in deionised water. Cleaning of the \ufb02 uid conduction system\nFrequency: Before putting into service for the \ufb01  rst time\n1. Prepare a container with cleaning solution and place \nthe fi  lling tube inside (manufacturers recommend using \ncleaning agents compatible with the dilutor). 2. Place the waste line inside the waste container.3. Run a feed or priming cycle until the fl  uid\u2019s lines becomes \nclean.4. Remove the fi  lling tube from the cleaning solution and \nplace it inside a container with deionised water. Start a feed or priming cycle again until the fl  uid trajectory is \nfree of cleaning solution. Discard the fl  uid and rinse the \nwaste container. 5. Suspend the feed cycle.6. Place the fl  uid propulsion system in the rest position. 7.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>a thermometer and an agitation unit to keep the temperature constant (not shown). OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nWater baths are made of steel and are generally c overed with electrostatic paint \nwith high adherence and resistance to environmental laboratory conditions. Water baths have an external panel on which the controls can be found. They also have a tank made of rustproof material with a collection of electrical resistors mounted on their lower part. By means of these, heat is transferred to the medium (water or oil) until reaching the temperature selected with a control device (thermostat or similar). The resistors may be of the following types:\u2022 Immersion type. These resistors are installed inside \na sealed tube and located on the lower part of the container in direct contact with heating medium. \u2022\u2022 External. These resistors are located on the lower part \nbut on the outside of the tank. These are protected by an isolating material which prevents heat loss. This type of resistor transfers the heat to the bottom of the tank through thermal conduction. The water bath is an instrument used in the laboratory for\n \u2022\n\u2022\nImmersion type. These resistors are installed iGMDN Code 36754 16772\nECRI Code 15-108 16-772\nDenomination Water bath Water bath, shaker\nFigure 16.

Immersion and external resistors    CHAPTER 5  WATER BATHS\n32Certain types of water bath have a series of accessories such \nas agitation systems or circulators, generating carefully controlled movement of the heating medium to keep the temperature uniform. A table which describes the main types of water baths is shown below. WATER BATH CONTROLS\nWater baths generally have very simple controls. Some manufacturers have incorporated controls with \nmicroprocessors. They vary depending on the type of bath. The diagram of a basic water bath\u2019s control panel is shown next. The control panel has these elements:\n1. The on and off   control switch\n2. A Menu button for selecting the operation\u2019s parameters: \noperation temperature, alarm temperature, temperature scale (\u00b0C, \u00b0F)\n3. Two buttons for parameter adjustment4. A screen 5. A pilot light6. Pilots (2) for identifying the temperature scale (\u00b0C, \u00b0F). WATER BATH OPERATION\nInstallation\n1. Install the water bath close to an electrical outlet. The \noutlet must ha ve its respective ground pole in order \nto guarantee the protection and safety of the operator and the equipment. Water baths generally operate at 120 V\/60 Hz or 230 V\/60Hz. Its installation and use is facilitated by a sink close by for supplying and draining of water. 2. Verify that the location selected is levelled and has the \nnecessary resistance to safely support the weight of the water bath when it is full of liquid. 3. Ensure that the location has a suitable amount of space \nfor putting the samples and the accessories required for the normal operation of the water bath. 4. Avoid placing the water bath where there are strong air \ncurrents which can interfere with its normal operation. For example: in front of an air-conditioning unit or window. Safety\n1. Avoid the use of the water bath in environments where \nther e are fl  ammable and combustible materials. The \nequipment has components (resistors generating very high temperatures) which could start an accidental fi  re \nor explosion. 2. Always connect the equipment to an electrical outlet \nwith a ground pole to protect the user and the equipment from electrical discharges. The electrical connection must comply with the required norms of the country and the laboratory. 3. Use the water bath exclusively with non-corrosive or \nnon-fl  ammable liquids. 4. Use personal protective elements when working with \nthe water bath. The bath has resistors which can cause burns if inadvertently touched, even a considerable time after turning off   the equipment. 5. When working with substances that generate vapours, \nplace the water bath under a chemical hood or in a well ventilated area. 6. Remember that liquids incubated in the water bath tank \ncan produce burns if hands are inadvertently placed inside it. 7. Take into account that the water bath is designed for \nuse with a liquid inside the tank. If the inside is dry, the temperature of the tank can become very high. Use the diff  using tray for placing the container inside of the \nfi lled tank of the water bath. This has been designed for \ndistributing the temperature in a uniform way. 8. Avoid using the water bath if any of its controls is not \nworking, e.g. the temperature or limit controls.Class Temperature range \nLow temperature  Room temperature up to 60 \u00b0C \nRoom temperature up to 100 \u00b0C\nHigh temperature Room temperature up to 275 \u00b0C. When it needs to \nreach temperatures above 100 \u00b0C, it is necessary to use fl  uids other than water as the boiling point of water is 100 \u00b0C under normal conditions\nThis type of bath generally uses oils which have much \nhigher boiling points.

The water distiller, also called distillation unit or water still, used in the laboratory, purifi  es running water by means of controlled \nvaporization and cooling processes. Upon applying thermal energy to water in a liquid phase by a warming process, it is changed into vapour. This allows the water molecules to separate from the molecules of other substances mixed or diluted. The water vapour is collected and passed through a condenser, where it is cooled and returned to the liquid phase. Then, the condensed water is collected into a diff  erent storage tank. Distilled water shows pure \ncharacteristics compared to running water; it is practically free of contaminating substances.PURPOSE OF THE WATER DISTILLER\nThe water distiller facilitates obtaining very pure water from potable wat er normally provided by the aqueduct services \nin urban centres. Distilled water is characterized by a lack of solids in suspension. It is used in multiple applications in centres which provide health services, especially in laboratory units, in washing, sterilization and dietetics. The more specialized the procedures are in the laboratory, the greater will be the level of purity required. For example: the preparation of reagents or biological material requires water of the highest quality. Distillation is one of the fundamental processes to achieve this (although it may not be the only one required). Water used in laboratories must be free of pyrogens, with a concentration of total solids no greater than 1 ppm, a pH value between 5.4 and 7.2 and an electrical resistance of at least 3 x 10\n5 ohm\/cm at 25 \u00b0C1. 1 Warming cabinets, sterilizers, and associated equipment , Division 11\u2013 \nEquipment, USACE\/NAVFAC\/ AFCESA, UFGS-11710, July 2003.

A process through which a fl  uid in liquid phase is heated until converted into vapour and then cooled and condensed back into liquid phase. The \ndistillation process is used for separating mixed substances, taking advantage of their diff  erence in volatility. To obtain ver y pure substances, consecutive distillation \ncycles are performed with the aim of progressively eliminating other substances present in the mix. Hardness (of water). A chemical characteristic of water determined by the carbonate, bicarbonate, chlorine, sulphate and occasionally calcium nitra te and \nmagnesium content. The resulting resistance is undesirable in some processes. There are two types of resistors in water. \u2022 Temporary hardness. This is determined by the magnesium and calcium carbonate and bicarbonate content. It may be eliminated by boiling the water a nd \nsubsequently fi  ltering out the precipitate. It is also known as carbonate resistance. \u2022 Permanent hardness. This is determined by all the calcium and magnesium salts, except the carbonates and bicarbonates. It cannot be eliminated by the \nboiling of water and it is also known as non-bicarbonate resistance.

Quantity in calcium [Ca] solution and magnesium [Mg] as cations, without taking into account the nature of the \nanions present in the water. It is expressed as ppm (parts per million) of calcium carbonate (CaCo3). Incrustation (scale). A name given to solids in suspension deposited in layers on the surface of water storage containers. Solution. A homogenous mix of two or more substances characterized by the absence of chemical reactions between the components of the li quid mixture. The \nliquid component which generally appears in greater proportion is called the solvent  and that found in a lesser quantity in solution, the solute .MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n59Chapter 9\nDilutor\nThe dilutor is used for diluting substances. Dilute comes \nfrom the Latin word diluere  and means to add liquid to a \nsolution. Solutions are defi  ned as homogeneous mixtures \nof two or more components which may be gaseous, liquid or solid. To dilute is to reduce the strength of a fl uid in a solvent, generally water. The dilutor facilitates \nthe preparation of liquid mixtures, until these achieve a proportion (concentration) suitable for use in different diagnostic processes. The identification of this type of equipment is generalized using the word dilutor. DIAGRAM OF A DILUTORPURPOSE OF THE DILUTOR\nThe purpose of the dilutor is to prepare mixtures of \nsubstanc es to achieve determined concentrations and \nvolumes as done with a pipette, but with the advantage of an automated or programmed process.

Functioning of the water distiller\nThe water distiller reproduces the natural phenomenon described abo ve. The configuration and design vary \ndepending on the volume of water required. The following is a general explanation of the components of a distiller and a description of how these function. 1. Vapour generator. Also known as the boiling tank, \nthis component is the container where the water to be distilled is stored. In general, it has a hydraulic connection which allows the water evaporated and distilled to be replenished. It is generally made of glass in small distillers or of stainless steel with copper, tin or titanium coverings in large capacity machines. It can have level, fl  ow and water quality feed controls, which \nprotect the distiller in case some irregularity in the water supply occurs. As a source of energy, it uses the water vapour coming from a boiler or vapour generator, or the thermal energy from electrical immersion resistors through direct conduction. These cause the water temperature to rise until, in normal conditions (atmospheric pressure equal to an atmosphere and gravity acceleration equal to 9.80665 m\/s\n2) water in the \nliquid phase is transformed into vapour at 100 \u00b0C. 2.<\/DOCUMENT>\n1.

This equipment, provided \nit is carefully used and calibrated, measures the acidity of an aqueous solution. pH meters are sometimes called pH analysers, pH monitors or potentiometers. PURPOSE OF THE EQUIPMENT\nThe pH meter is commonly used in any fi  eld of science \nrelated to aqueous solutions. It is used in areas such as agriculture, water treatment and purifi  cation, in industrial \nprocesses such as petrochemicals, paper manufacture, foods, pharmaceuticals, research and development, metal mechanics, etc. In the health laboratory, its applications are related to the control of culture mediums and to the measurement of the alkalinity or acidity of broths and buff ers. In specialized laboratories, diagnostic equipment \nmicroelectrodes are used to measure the pH of liquid blood components. The plasma pH allows the patient\u2019s health to be evaluated. It normally measures between 7.35 and 7.45. This value relates to the patient\u2019s metabolism in which a multitude of reactions occurs where acids and bases are normally kept in balance. Acids constantly liberate hydrogen ions [H\n+] and the organism neutralizes or balances \nacidity by liberating bicarbonate ions [HCO3\u2013]. The acid-base \nratio in the organism is maintained by the kidneys, (organs in which any excesses present are eliminated). The plasma pH is one of the characteristics that vary with factors such as age or state of health of the patient. Table 1 shows typical pH values of some bodily fl  uids.PHOTOGRAPH AND COMPONENTS OF THE \npH METER\nOPERA TION PRINCIPLES\nThe pH meter measures the concentration of hydrogen ions \n[H+] using an ion-sensitive electrode.

The reference electrode is usually made of the same type of material as the internal electrode. Both tubes, interior and exterior, contain a reference solution. Only the outer tube has contact with the measured solution through a porous cap which acts as a saline bridge. This device acts like a galvanized cell. The reference electrode \nis the internal tube of the pH meter probe, which cannot lose ions through interactions with the surrounding environment. Therefore as a reference, it remains static (unchangeable) during the measuring process. The external tube of the probe contains the medium which is allowed  to mix with the external environment. As a result, this tube must be fi lled periodically with a potassium chloride solution (KCI) \nfor restoring the capacity of the electrode which would otherwise be inhibited by a loss of ions and evaporation. The glass bulb on the lower part of the pH electrode acts \nas a measuring element and is covered with a layer of hydrated gel on its exterior and interior. Metallic sodium cations [Na\n+] are diff  used in the hydrated gel outside of \nthe glass and in the solution, while the hydrogen ions [H+] \nare diff  used in the gel. This gel makes the pH electrode \nion-selective:  Hydrogen ions [H+] cannot pass through the \nglass membrane of the pH electrode. Sodium ions [Na+] pass \nthrough and cause a change in free energy, which the pH meter measures. A brief explanation of the theory on how electrodes function is included in the appendix at the end of the chapter.pH METER COMPONENTS \nA pH meter generally has the following components: 1. The body of the instrument containing the circuits, \ncontrols, connectors, display screens and measuring scales. The following are among some of its most \nimportant components:\na) An ON and OFF switch. Not all pH meters have an \non and off   switch. Some simply have a cord with a \nplug which allows it to be connected to a suitable electrical outlet. b) Temperature control. This control allows \nadjustments according to the temperature of the solution measured. c) Calibration controls. Depending on the design, \npH meters possess one or two calibration buttons or dials. Normally these are identifi  ed by Cal 1  and \nCal 2 . If the pH meter is calibrated using only one \nsolution, the Cal 1 button is used; making sure that Cal 2 is set at a 100%. If the pH meter allows  two point calibrations, two known pH solutions covering the range of pH to be measured are used. In this case, the two controls are used (Cal 1 and Cal 2). In special cases, a three-point calibration must be done (using three known pH solutions). d) Mode selector.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Place the calibration plate on the equipment. 2.

Recently manufactured centrifuges have incorporated \nnumerous improvements into their design to provide greater safety and longer operational life. Among advances mentioned are controls based on microprocessors. By means of software  controlled by a keyboard, these have several \ndiff erent operational programs in memory. According to the \ntype of rotor being used and procedure conducted, these programs control the centrifugation time, the required temperature, the rotor\u2019s revolutions, the acceleration and deceleration, alarms warning the operator about any anomaly during operation. Manufacturers have also incorporated induction motors \n(without brushes) in centrifuges. These have the advantage of electronically controlling currents and magnetic fields regulating the rotor\u2019s speed which reduces the frequency of maintenance. Operation and maintenance of such equipment must be carried out according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS\nCentrifuges require the following for normal operation:1. An electrical connection with a capacity suitable for the \nequipment providing stable single phase or triphase type voltage (depending on the model and specifi  cation \ngiven by the manufacturer). In general, centrifuges use 110V or 220 V\/60 Hz. 2.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Allows work with small quantities of toxic and \nradioactive chemicals. CLASS II \u2014 TYPE B2\n1.

The water distiller, also called distillation unit or water still, used in the laboratory, purifi  es running water by means of controlled \nvaporization and cooling processes. Upon applying thermal energy to water in a liquid phase by a warming process, it is changed into vapour. This allows the water molecules to separate from the molecules of other substances mixed or diluted. The water vapour is collected and passed through a condenser, where it is cooled and returned to the liquid phase. Then, the condensed water is collected into a diff  erent storage tank. Distilled water shows pure \ncharacteristics compared to running water; it is practically free of contaminating substances.PURPOSE OF THE WATER DISTILLER\nThe water distiller facilitates obtaining very pure water from potable wat er normally provided by the aqueduct services \nin urban centres. Distilled water is characterized by a lack of solids in suspension. It is used in multiple applications in centres which provide health services, especially in laboratory units, in washing, sterilization and dietetics. The more specialized the procedures are in the laboratory, the greater will be the level of purity required. For example: the preparation of reagents or biological material requires water of the highest quality.

Dilutor diagram    CHAPTER 9  DILUTOR\n60OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThe dilutor has various components which interact in a \ncoordinated manner to handle liquids and mix volumes \nwith great precision, which allows known solutions of between 1 \u00b5l and 25 ml to be prepared. The dilutor has in general, the following components:1. A propulsion system2. A control system3. A dispensing system\nPropulsion system\nThis is generally constituted of positive displacement systems as found in syringes. One or more selectable \nsyringes (with a varying capacity) is\/are used in the dilutor to control the volume to be mixed or diluted. The syringes\u2019 pistons are moved by a mechanism which controls their position. Aspirated volumes or deliveries are calculated by means of the following equation:\nWhere: \n\u2202 V =  fraction of the volume delivered by the syringe when the piston has a displacement   \u2202l.A =  piston area. The total volume aspirated or delivered is the corresponding \nintegral: \n where l\no and l1 correspond to the positions that defi  ne the \npiston\u2019s displacement.Controlling how the pistons move facilitates good control \nover the volumes handled. The displacement system is activated by an electric motor which moves a very precise nuts and screws system and changes the position of the piston. A set of valves controlling the aspiration and supply processes complements the syringes and their displacement systems. The confi  guration of the dilutor depends on the \nmodel and manufacturers. Control system\nModern dilutors have a control system which is automatic or controlled by microprocessors. The latter allow the following \nto be selected and controlled:1. Mixing processes and\/or dissolution of substances \n(programmable)\n2. Predefi  ned volume supply\n3. Supply or suction velocities4. Number of required cycles5. Size or volume of selected syringes6.

A measuring device known as \u201cload cell\u201d produces an \nexit signal corresponding to the load\u2019s force in the form of changes in the voltage or frequency. 3. A digital analogous electronic circuit shows the fi  nal \nresult of the weight digitally. Laboratory balances operate according to the principle \nof compensation of the electromagnetic force applicable to displacements or torques. The combination of their mechanical components and automatic reading systems provides weight measurements at defi  ned levels of accuracy \ndepending on the model. Principle. The mobile parts (weighing plate, support \ncolumn [a], bobbin, position and load indicator [G] -the object in the process of being weighed-) are maintained in equilibrium by a compensation force [F] equal to the weight. The compensation force is generated by an electrical current through a bobbin in the air gap of a cylindrical electromagnet. The force F is calculated with the equation [F = I x L x B] where: I = electrical intensity, L = total length of the wire of the coil and B = magnetic fl  ow intensity in the \nelectromagnet\u2019s air gap.With any change in the load (weight\/mass), the mobile \nmechanical system responds by moving vertically a fraction of distance. Detected by a photosensor [e], an electrical signal is sent to the servo-amplifi  er [f]. This changes the \nfl ow of electrical current passing through the bobbin of the \nmagnet [c] in such a manner that the mobile system returns to the balanced position upon adjusting of the magnetic fl ow in the electromagnet. Consequently, the weight of \nthe mass [G] can be measured indirectly at the start of the electrical current fl  ow, which passes through the circuit \nmeasuring the voltage [V] by means of a precision resistor [R], [V = I x R]. To date, many systems developed use the electronic system for carrying out very exact measurements of mass and weight. The following diagram explains how electronic balances function.

It is controlled by a button generally located on the front part of the balance. It is commonly used for taring the weighing container. 2. Repeatability setting control.

This function is very useful when weighing operations need to be carried out in unstable conditions, e.g. in the presence of air currents or vibrations.

The \ncentrifuge is designed to use the centrifugal force generated in rotational movements to separate the constitutive elements of a mixture. There is a wide range of centrifuges capable of serving specifi  c industry and research needs. This \nchapter focuses on standing centrifuges normally used in public health and clinical laboratories. PHOTOGRAPH OF CENTRIFUGEPURPOSE OF THE CENTRIFUGE\nThe centrifuge uses centrifugal force (the force generated \nwhen an objec t rotates around a single point), for separating \nsolids suspended in a liquid by sedimentation, or liquids of diverse density. The rotational movements allow forces much greater than gravity to be generated in controlled periods of time. In the laboratory, centrifuges are generally used in processes such as the separation of solid components from biological liquids through sedimentation and in particular of blood components: red cells, white cells, platelets among others and for conducting multiple tests and treatments.There are several kinds of centrifuges. The most widely used in public health, surveillance and clinical laboratories are the table-top centrifuge, the ultracentrifuge, the haeamatocrit centrifuge and the standing centrifuge. OPERATION PRINCIPLES \nCentrifuges represent a practical application of Newton\u2019s law of motion. When a body of mass [m] turns around \na central point [O], it is subjected to a centripetal  force \n[N] directed towards the rotation axis with a magnitude N = m\u03c9\n2R, where [m] is the mass of the body, [R] is the radius \nand \u03c9 is the angular speed. Centrifuges possess a rotating axis on which is mounted a rotor with sample receiving compartments. Tangential speed is defi  ned by the following \nequation: VT=\u03c9R. Photo courtesy of Beckman CoulterCHAPTER 7  CENTRIFUGE\n46When the system spins at a speed of \u03c9 radians per second, \nthe samples are subjected to the centrifugal force Fp of the \nsame magnitude as N, but in an opposite direction. The \nfi gure shown below1 features a diagram of the concept, \nof its actual application and of the obtained result. This Fp force acts on particles in the substance centrifuged, \ncausing them to separate as a result of diff  erences in density. Denser particles will settle at the bottom of the tube in shorter periods of time, while lighter ones require longer periods of time, settling onto those of greater density. The relationship between the centrifugal acceleration [\u03c9\n2r ] to a \ngiven radius [r] and the force of gravity [g] is known as the relative centrifugal fi  eld or [RCF]\n2. RCF =r\u03c92\ng\nThe RCF is the tool which allows rotors of different \nspecifi  cations to be compared when equivalent centrifugal \neff ects are required. COMPONENTS OF THE CENTRIFUGE \nThe most important components of a centrifuge are the \nfollowing3:\nThe electric\/electronic control which generally has the following elements:1. On and off control, operation time control (timer), \nrotation speed control (in some centrifuges), temperature control (in refrigerated centrifuges), vibration control (safety mechanism) and brake system.2.

Recently manufactured centrifuges have incorporated \nnumerous improvements into their design to provide greater safety and longer operational life. Among advances mentioned are controls based on microprocessors. By means of software  controlled by a keyboard, these have several \ndiff erent operational programs in memory. According to the \ntype of rotor being used and procedure conducted, these programs control the centrifugation time, the required temperature, the rotor\u2019s revolutions, the acceleration and deceleration, alarms warning the operator about any anomaly during operation. Manufacturers have also incorporated induction motors \n(without brushes) in centrifuges. These have the advantage of electronically controlling currents and magnetic fields regulating the rotor\u2019s speed which reduces the frequency of maintenance. Operation and maintenance of such equipment must be carried out according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS\nCentrifuges require the following for normal operation:1. An electrical connection with a capacity suitable for the \nequipment providing stable single phase or triphase type voltage (depending on the model and specifi  cation \ngiven by the manufacturer). In general, centrifuges use 110V or 220 V\/60 Hz. 2.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Air supply.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>2. A stable work table located away from equipment \nthat generates vibrations, (centrifuges, and agitators). It must be of a suitable size to locate the necessary complementary equipment: reader, incubator, distributor and computer with its peripheral attachments at the side of the microplate washer. 3. An electric outlet in good condition with a ground pole \nand, an electrical connection which complies with the \ncountry\u2019s or the laboratory\u2019s norms and standards. In the \ncountries of the Americas, the 110 V and 60 Hz frequency \nis generally used. In other parts of the World, the 220-240 \nV and 50\/60 Hz frequency is generally used.

OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThe biological safety cabinet is a chamber generally constructed of steel. It has a front glass window of adjustable \nheight, a ventilation system with an electrical motor, a ventilator and a set of ducts which while functioning, generate a negative pressure condition inside the cabinet. This forces the air to fl  ow from inside the cabinet through \nthe front opening to generate a curtain of air protecting the operator. Internally, the air is conducted through a series of grids and ducts to be finally treated in HEPA\n1  \nfi lters. Depending on the design of the cabinet, the air is \nrecycled inside the laboratory or extracted and renewed in diverse proportions. The air fl  ow, which in Class II cabinets \nmoves from the fi  lter towards the work surface, is laminar. A \nsummary of the existing type of cabinets and their principal characteristics is presented next. 1 HEPA: High Effi   ciency Particulate Air.

The technique \nis based on the detection of an antigen or antibodies captured on a solid surface using direct or secondary, labelled antibodies, producing a reaction whose product can be read by the spectrophotometer. The word ELISA is the acronym for \u201cEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay\u201d . This chapter covers the use of microplate readers for ELISA testing. For additional information on the instrument principles of operation and maintenance, consult Chapter 11 discussing the spectrophotometer. PHOTOGRAPH OF MICROPLATE READER\nPURPOSE OF THE MICROPLATE READER\nThe microplate reader is used for reading the results of ELISA \ntests. This technique has a direct application in immunology and serology. Among other applications it confi  rms the \npresence of antibodies or antigens of an infectious agent in an organism, antibodies from a vaccine or auto-antibodies, for example in rheumatoid arthritis.OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThe microplate reader is a specialized spectrophotometer. Unlike the c onventional spectrophotometer which facilitates \nreadings on a wide range of wavelengths, the microplate reader has filters or diffraction gratings that limit the wavelength range to that used in ELISA, generally between 400 to 750 nm (nanometres). Some readers operate in the ultraviolet range and carry out analyses between 340 to 700 nm. The optical system exploited by many manufacturers uses optic fi  bres to supply light to the microplate wells \ncontaining the samples. The light beam, passing through the sample has a diameter ranging between 1 to 3 mm. A detection system detects the light coming from the sample, amplifi  es the signal and determines the sample\u2019s \nabsorbance. A reading system converts it into data allowing the test result interpretation. Some microplate readers use double beam light systems. Test samples are located in specially designed plates with \na specifi  c number of wells where the procedure or test is \ncarried out. Plates of 8 columns by 12 rows with a total of 96 wells are common. There are also plates with a greater number of wells. For specialized applications, the current trend is to increase the number of wells (384-well plates) to reduce the amount of reagents and samples used and a greater throughput. The location of the optical sensors of the microplate reader varies depending on the manufacturers: these can be located above the sample plate, or directly underneath the plate\u2019s wells. Nowadays microplate readers have controls regulated by \nmicroprocessors; connection interfaces to information systems; quality and process control programs, which by means of a computer, allow complete test automation.Chapter 1\nMicroplate Reader\nGMDN Code 37036\nECRI Code 16-979\nDenomination Photometric micro-plate reader\nPhoto courtesy of BioRad Laboratories CHAPTER 1  MICROPLATE READER\n2Equipment required for ELISA testing\nIn order to perform the ELISA technique, the following \nequipment is r equired:  \n1.

Place electrodes in the calibration solution. 2.1 Submerge the electrode in the standardization \nsolution in such a manner that its lower extremity does not touch the bottom of the beaker. This decreases the risk of breaking the electrode. If the test requires that the solution be kept in motion using the magnetic agitator, special care must be taken so that the agitation rod does not hit the electrode as this could break it.

Its purpose is to give a better \nunderstanding of the technical requirements regarding installation, use and maintenance of various types of equipment which play an important role in performing diagnostic testing. The manual also aims to provide support to personnel responsible for technical management, implementation of quality management and maintenance. Due to the diversity of origins, brands and models, this manual off  ers general recommendations. Equipment-specifi  c details \nare explained in depth in the maintenance and installation user manuals from manufacturers. These should be requested and ordered through the procurement processes of the individual agencies and professionals responsible for the acquisition of technology, or directly from the manufacturer. This manual was originally developed by the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) to support improved quality \nprogrammes which PAHO promotes in regional laboratories. The English version was produced by WHO to further expand support for quality programmes in other regions. The revised edition now includes 20 equipment groups selected to cover those most commonly used in low to medium technical complexity laboratories across the world. Given the diff  erences in \ntechnical complexity, brands and existing models, each chapter has been developed with basic equipment in mind, including new technology where relevant. The following information is included in each chapter: \n\u2022\u2022 Groups of equipment, organized by their generic names. Alternative names have also been included. \u2022\u2022 Photographs or diagrams, or a combination of both t o identify the type of equipment under consideration. \u2022\u2022 A brief explanation on the main uses or applications of the equipment in the laboratory. \u2022\u2022 A basic description of the principles by which the equipment operates with explanations of principles or physical and\/or \nchemical la ws which the interested reader can \u2013 or should study in depth. \u2022\u2022 Installation requirements with emphasis on the electrical aspects and the r equirements for safe installation and operation, \nincluding worldwide electrical standards. \u2022\u2022 Basic routine maintenance, classifi  ed according to the required frequency (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually \nor sporadically). The procedures are numbered and presented in the actual sequence in which these should take place (model-specifi  c procedures can be found in the manuals published by the manufacturers). \u2022\u2022 Troubleshooting tables with the most frequent problems aff  ecting the equipment with possible causes and actions that \nmay resolve these problems. \u2022\u2022 A list of basic defi  nitions of some of the specialized terms used.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Assemble again in the reverse order to that described. Sterilization of the distilled water storage tank1 The minerals deposited on the cover of the immersion resistors are \nparticularly poor heat conductors in that they impede an effi   cient transfer \nof heat between the immersion resistance and the water in the distillation process. This makes the temperature of the resistance rise above that it would reach in normal operating conditions, deteriorating its condition and integrity.. CHAPTER 8  WATER DISTILLER\n56Frequency: Occasionally\nBefore operating a new water distiller, it is recommended to insure that the distilled water storage tank is sterile and clean. To carry out the sterilization, use a chemical process with domestic bleach (chlorine based), for example.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Risk level 1 group  is composed of biological agents \nvery unlikely to cause sickness in healthy humans or animals.

The term local is used to emphasize that this acceleration depends on factors such as the geographical latitude, altitude and the Earth\u2019s density where the measurement is taken. This force is measured in Newtons.

In the laboratory, the balance is used \nfor weighing as part of quality control activities (on devices like pipettes), in the preparation of mixtures of components in predefined proportions and in the determination of specifi  c densities or weights. OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThere are diff  erences in design, principles and criteria of \nmetrology amongst balances. At present, there are two large groups of balances: mechanical and electronic balances. Mechanical balances \nThe following are some of the more common ones: 1. Spring balance. Its function is based on a mechanical \nproperty of springs as the force exercised on a spring is proportional to the spring\u2019s elasticity constant [k], multiplied by its elongation [x] [F = -kx]. The greater the mass [m] placed on the balance\u2019s plate, the greater the elongation will be, given that the elongation is proportional to the mass and the spring\u2019s constant. The calibration of a spring balance depends on the force of gravity acting on the object weighed. This type of balance is used when great precision is not necessary. 2. Sliding weight balance. This type of balance is \nequipped with two known weights which can be moved on setting scales (one macro, the other micro). Upon placing a substance of unknown mass on the tray, its weight is determined by moving the weight on both setting scales until the equilibrium position is reached. At this point, the weight is obtained by adding both quantities indicated by the sliding masses\u2019 position on the scale. 3. Analytical balance. This balance functions by comparing \nknown weight masses with that of a substance of unknown weight. It is composed of a base on a bar or symmetrical lever, maintained by a blade-like support on a central point called a fulcrum. At its ends, there are stirrups, also supported with blades which allow these to oscillate smoothly. From there, two plates are suspended. Certifi  ed weights are placed on one \nof the plates and unknown weights on the other. The balance has a securing system or lock, which allows the main lever to remain stable when not in use or when it is necessary to modify the counter-weights. The balance is inside an external box which protects it from interferences, such as air currents. Analytical balances can weigh ten thousandths of a gram (0.0001 g) or 100 thousandths of a gram (0.00001 g). This type of balance generally has a capacity of up to 200 grams.

Analytical balance  MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n23It is necessary to have a set of certifi  ed masses. The set is \ngenerally composed of the following pieces:\n4. Upper plate balance (Top loading or parallel guidance \nbalance). This type of balance has a loading plate located \non its upper part, supported by a column maintained in a vertical position by two pairs of guides with fl  exible \nconnections. The eff  ect of the force produced by the \nmass is transmitted from a point on the vertical column directly or by some mechanical means to the loading cell. The requirement with this type of mechanism is that parallel guides must be maintained with exactitude of up to \u00b1 1  \u00b5m. Deviations in parallelism cause an error known \nas lateral load (when the mass being weighed shows diff erences if the reading is taken at the centre of the \nplate or on one of its sides). The diagram shown below explains the operation principle some manufacturers have introduced in electronic balances.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Check the lubrication state of elements such as for \nO-rings as the manufacturer recommends.

Its purpose is to give a better \nunderstanding of the technical requirements regarding installation, use and maintenance of various types of equipment which play an important role in performing diagnostic testing. The manual also aims to provide support to personnel responsible for technical management, implementation of quality management and maintenance. Due to the diversity of origins, brands and models, this manual off  ers general recommendations. Equipment-specifi  c details \nare explained in depth in the maintenance and installation user manuals from manufacturers. These should be requested and ordered through the procurement processes of the individual agencies and professionals responsible for the acquisition of technology, or directly from the manufacturer. This manual was originally developed by the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) to support improved quality \nprogrammes which PAHO promotes in regional laboratories. The English version was produced by WHO to further expand support for quality programmes in other regions. The revised edition now includes 20 equipment groups selected to cover those most commonly used in low to medium technical complexity laboratories across the world. Given the diff  erences in \ntechnical complexity, brands and existing models, each chapter has been developed with basic equipment in mind, including new technology where relevant. The following information is included in each chapter: \n\u2022\u2022 Groups of equipment, organized by their generic names. Alternative names have also been included. \u2022\u2022 Photographs or diagrams, or a combination of both t o identify the type of equipment under consideration. \u2022\u2022 A brief explanation on the main uses or applications of the equipment in the laboratory. \u2022\u2022 A basic description of the principles by which the equipment operates with explanations of principles or physical and\/or \nchemical la ws which the interested reader can \u2013 or should study in depth. \u2022\u2022 Installation requirements with emphasis on the electrical aspects and the r equirements for safe installation and operation, \nincluding worldwide electrical standards. \u2022\u2022 Basic routine maintenance, classifi  ed according to the required frequency (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually \nor sporadically). The procedures are numbered and presented in the actual sequence in which these should take place (model-specifi  c procedures can be found in the manuals published by the manufacturers). \u2022\u2022 Troubleshooting tables with the most frequent problems aff  ecting the equipment with possible causes and actions that \nmay resolve these problems. \u2022\u2022 A list of basic defi  nitions of some of the specialized terms used.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Connect the water bath.

Carry out a complete reading with the calibration plate. Verify if there are diff  erences in the readings obtained \nfrom well to well. If this is the case, invert the plate (180\u00b0) and repeat the reading to rule out that diff  erences are \nattributed to the plate itself. In general, it is accepted that the instrument does not need further calibration if the plate results are as expected at two wavelengths. 3. Verify if the reader requires calibration. If so, proceed \nwith the calibration following the routine outlined by the manufacturer, verifying that the reading\u2019s linearity is maintained as rigorously as possible. 4. If the instrument does not have a calibration plate, verify \nit by placing a coloured solution in the wells of a plate and immediately carry out a complete reading. Then invert the plate 180\u00b0 and read the plate again. If both readings display identical, average values in each row, the reader is calibrated. 5. Verify that the reader is calibrated, column by column. Place a clean, empty plate and carry out a reading. If there is no diff  erence between each of the average \nreading of the fi  rst to the last column, it can be assumed \nthat the reader is calibrated. ROUTINE MAINTENANCE \nMaintenance described next focuses exclusively on the micr oplate reader. The maintenance of the microplate \nwasher is described in Chapter 2. Basic maintenance \nFrequency: Daily1. Review that optical sensors of each channel are clean. If dirt is detected, clean the surface of the windows of the light emitters and the sensors with a small brush. 2. Confi  rm that the lighting system is clean. 3. Verify that the reader\u2019s calibration is adequate. When \nthe daily operations begin, let the reader warm up for 30 minutes. Next, do a blank reading and then read a full plate of substrate. The readings must be identical. If not, invert the plate and repeat the reading in order to determine if the deviation originated in the plate or the reader. 4. Examine the automatic drawer sliding system. It must \nbe smooth and constant.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Angular speed. The turning rate of a body measured in radians per second. It is calculated using the following formula:\nWhere: \nrpm = revolutions per minute\u03c0 = constant with a value of 3.1416\nBrush. A device that transmits electrical energy between the external electrical connection (cables in a static state) and the intern al components (in rotation) of a \nmotor. In general, brushes are manufactured in very soft textured graphite and, in motors, must be changed regularly (every six  months). Centrifugal force. Apparent force equal and opposite to the centripetal force, driving a rotating body away from the centre of rotation and cause d by the inertia of \nthe body. It is one of the components of the inertia vector, which equals the set of forces acting on a body. Its magnitude is always [m x a\nn] and its direction radial, \nmoving away from the centre. Density. A body\u2019s mass by volume unit, generally expressed in gram per cm3. Isopycnic separation. A method for separating particles based on the density of the particle\u2019s fl  otation. It is known as sedimentation in balance. T he speed of a \nparticle due to diff  erences in density is given in the formula:\nWhere: \nv = speed of sedimentation\nd = diameter of the particle \n\u03c1p = density of the particle \n\u03c1c = density of the solution\n \u00b5 = viscosity of the liquid medium g = gravitational force \nRadian. A unit of angular measure equal to the angle subtended at the centre of a circle by an arc equal in length to the radius of th e circle.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>7. Use titanium rotors if working with saline solutions \nfrequently. 8. Protect the rotors\u2019 coating in order to avoid the metal \nbase from deteriorating. Do not use alkaline detergents or cleaning solutions which can remove the protective fi lm. The rotors generally made of aluminium [Al] are \ncovered by a fi  lm of anodized aluminium which protects \ntheir metal structure. 9. Use plastic brushes when cleaning the rotor. Metal \nbrushes scratch the protective coating and generate sources for future corrosion. Corrosion is accelerated in operation conditions and shortens the rotor\u2019s operational life. 10. If there are spills of corrosive substances, wash the rotor \nimmediately. 11. Air dry the rotor once cleaned and washed with water.12. Store vertical tube rotors and almost vertical tube rotors \nwith the larger side facing downwards and without their covers. 13. Store rotors in a dry area. Avoid leaving them in the \ncentrifuge. 14. Store swinging buckets rotors without the compartments\u2019 \ncovers. 15. Lubricate spiral and O-rings, according to the \nmanufacturer\u2019s recommendation. 16. Observe re commendations related to guaranteed times \nand operational life of each type of rotor. 17. Av oid using rotors whose operational lives have \nended. 18. Use a shield if working with radioactive material. 19. Load or unload rotors inside a biological safety cabinet \nif working with materials classifi  ed as Biosafety level II \nor higher. 20. Never try to open the cover of a centrifuge while it is \nfunctioning and never try to stop the rotor by hand. Tubes \nTube care includes aspects such as fi  lling of the tubes, adequat e temperature selection, centrifugation speed \nlimitations, washing and sterilization. The principle recommendations are the following:1. Wash tubes, adaptors and other accessories by hand \nusing a 1:10 mild detergent solution in water and a soft textured brush (not metallic). Avoid using automatic dishwashers. 2. Avoid using alcohol and acetone since such liquids aff  ect \nthe structure of the tubes. Manufacturers recommend the solvent to be used with each type of centrifugation tube material. 3. Avoid drying tubes in a drying oven. Dry always with a \nstream of hot air.4. Verify if the tubes are reusable or not. If they are \ndisposable, use them only once. 5. For sterilizing, it is necessary to verify the material from \nwhich the tube is made, as not all can stand sterilization by heat. Glass tubes are normally sterilized with vapour at 121 \u00b0C for 30 minutes. 6. Store tubes and bottles in a dark, fresh, dry place, \nfar from chemical vapours or ultraviolet radiation sources. 7. Verify maximum fi  lling levels and the sealing of thin \nwall tubes in order to avoid collapse inside the rotor by the action of the centrifugal force. Comply with manufacturers recommendations. Preventive maintenance\nWarning:  Nev er carry out a technical intervention in a \ncentrifuge if it has not been previously decontaminated. The most important maintenance routines performed on a \ncentrifuge are the following:Frequency: Monthly1. Verify that the centrifuge external components are free \nof dust and stains. Avoid aff  ecting the rotor with spills. Clean the rotor compartment using a mild detergent. 2. Test that the rotors\u2019 connecting and adjustment \nmechanisms are in good condition. Keep the points lubricated as the manufacturer recommends. 3. Verify the locking \/safety mechanism of the centrifuge\u2019s \ncover. This is fundamental in guaranteeing operators\u2019 safety as this mechanism keeps the cover of the centrifuge closed while the rotor is turning. 4.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>3.

The water distiller, also called distillation unit or water still, used in the laboratory, purifi  es running water by means of controlled \nvaporization and cooling processes. Upon applying thermal energy to water in a liquid phase by a warming process, it is changed into vapour. This allows the water molecules to separate from the molecules of other substances mixed or diluted. The water vapour is collected and passed through a condenser, where it is cooled and returned to the liquid phase. Then, the condensed water is collected into a diff  erent storage tank. Distilled water shows pure \ncharacteristics compared to running water; it is practically free of contaminating substances.PURPOSE OF THE WATER DISTILLER\nThe water distiller facilitates obtaining very pure water from potable wat er normally provided by the aqueduct services \nin urban centres. Distilled water is characterized by a lack of solids in suspension. It is used in multiple applications in centres which provide health services, especially in laboratory units, in washing, sterilization and dietetics. The more specialized the procedures are in the laboratory, the greater will be the level of purity required. For example: the preparation of reagents or biological material requires water of the highest quality. Distillation is one of the fundamental processes to achieve this (although it may not be the only one required). Water used in laboratories must be free of pyrogens, with a concentration of total solids no greater than 1 ppm, a pH value between 5.4 and 7.2 and an electrical resistance of at least 3 x 10\n5 ohm\/cm at 25 \u00b0C1. 1 Warming cabinets, sterilizers, and associated equipment , Division 11\u2013 \nEquipment, USACE\/NAVFAC\/ AFCESA, UFGS-11710, July 2003.

Calibration of the microplate reader \nThe calibration of a microplate reader is a specialized process which must be ex ecuted by a technician or trained engineer \nfollowing the instructions provided by each manufacturer. In order to do the calibration, it is necessary to have a set of grey fi  lters mounted on a plate of equal geometric size \nto those used in the analyses. Manufacturers provide these calibration plates for any wavelength the equipment uses. Calibration plates are equipped with at least three pre-\nestablished optic density values within the measurement ranges; low, medium, and high value. In order to perform the calibration, follow this process:1.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Substitution balance CHAPTER 4  BALANCES\n244. Verify the plate\u2019s brake. It is mounted on a threaded \naxis which touches the plate in order to prevent it from oscillating when the balance is locked.

This equipment, provided \nit is carefully used and calibrated, measures the acidity of an aqueous solution. pH meters are sometimes called pH analysers, pH monitors or potentiometers. PURPOSE OF THE EQUIPMENT\nThe pH meter is commonly used in any fi  eld of science \nrelated to aqueous solutions. It is used in areas such as agriculture, water treatment and purifi  cation, in industrial \nprocesses such as petrochemicals, paper manufacture, foods, pharmaceuticals, research and development, metal mechanics, etc. In the health laboratory, its applications are related to the control of culture mediums and to the measurement of the alkalinity or acidity of broths and buff ers. In specialized laboratories, diagnostic equipment \nmicroelectrodes are used to measure the pH of liquid blood components. The plasma pH allows the patient\u2019s health to be evaluated. It normally measures between 7.35 and 7.45. This value relates to the patient\u2019s metabolism in which a multitude of reactions occurs where acids and bases are normally kept in balance. Acids constantly liberate hydrogen ions [H\n+] and the organism neutralizes or balances \nacidity by liberating bicarbonate ions [HCO3\u2013]. The acid-base \nratio in the organism is maintained by the kidneys, (organs in which any excesses present are eliminated). The plasma pH is one of the characteristics that vary with factors such as age or state of health of the patient. Table 1 shows typical pH values of some bodily fl  uids.PHOTOGRAPH AND COMPONENTS OF THE \npH METER\nOPERA TION PRINCIPLES\nThe pH meter measures the concentration of hydrogen ions \n[H+] using an ion-sensitive electrode.

PHOTOGRAPH OF MICROPLATE WASHER \nPURPOSE OF THE MICROPLATE WASHER \nThe microplate washer has been designed to supply cleaning \nbuff ers required for the ELISA technique in a controlled \nmanner. In the same fashion, the equipment removes from each well, substances in excess from the reaction. Depending on the test performed, the washer can intervene from one to four times, supplying the washing buff  er, agitating and \nremoving the unbound reagents\n1 until the programmed \ntimes and cycles are completed. The washer has of two reservoirs; one for the washing buff  er, the other for the waste \ngenerated during the washing process.OPERATION PRINCIPLES \nThe microplate washer has been designed to perform washing operations in the ELISA t echnique. The equipment \npossesses at least, the following subsystems which vary depending on the manufacturer\u2019s design. \u2022\u2022 Control subsystem. Generally , the washer is controlled \nby microprocessors allowing programming and controlling steps to be performed by the washer such as: number of washing cycles\n2 (1\u20135); expected times; \nsupplying and extracting pressures; plate format (96\u2013384 wells); suction function adjustment according to the type of well\n3 (fl at bottom, V bottom or rounded \nbottom or strips used); volumes distributed or aspirated; the soaking and agitation cycles, etc. \u2022\u2022 Supply subsystem. In general, this comprises a reservoir \nfor the washing solution; one or several pumps; usually a positive displacement type syringe and a dispenser head that supplies the washing solution to the diff  erent \nwells by means of needles. The head usually comes with eight pairs of needles for washing and aspirating simultaneously the wells of the same row (the supply and extraction sub-systems converge on the head). There are models with twelve pairs of needles and others that conduct the washing process simultaneously in all the wells. Some washers off  er the possibility of working \nwith diff  erent types of washing solutions, performing \nthe solution changes according to the program entered by the operator. 1 See a brief explication of the ELISA technique in Chapter 1, Microplate \nReader . 2 The exact number of washing operations required depends on the assay \nused.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>4.

This is a balance with a single plate. An unknown mass is placed on the weighing plate. It is weighed by removing known masses from the counterweight side until it reaches a balanced position, using a mechanical system of cams. The fulcrum is generally off  -centre in relation to the length of the load \nbeam and located near the front of the balance. When a mass is placed on the weight plate and the balance\u2019s locking mechanism is released, the movement of the load beam is projected through an optical system to a screen located on the front part of the instrument. Operation veri\ufb01  cation\nThe procedure used for verifying the functioning of a typical \nmechanical balanc e is described below. The described \nprocess is based on the substitution balance.1. Verify that the balance is levelled. The levelling is \nachieved using a ring-shaped adjustment mechanism located on the base of the balance or by adjusting a bubble or knob on a scale located on the front of the balance\u2019s base. 2. Test the  zero mechanism. Place the controls on zero \nand free the balance. If the reading does not stay at zero, adjust the zero mechanism (a grooved screw located in a horizontal position near the fulcrum). To do this, it is necessary to block the balance and slightly adjust the mechanism. The process is to be continued until the zero adjusts correctly on the reading scale.3. Verify and adjust the sensitivity. This is always readjusted \nwhenever some internal adjustment is done. It is performed with a known standard according to the following steps:\na) Lock the balance.b) Place a standard weight (equivalent to the optical \nscale range) on the plate. c) Position the micro setting to one (1). d) Release the balance. e) Adjust to the zero position.f) Position the micro setting to zero (0). The balance \nshould indicate 100. If the scale displays less or more than 100, the sensitivity control must be adjusted. This requires locking the balance, opening the upper cover and turning the sensitivity screw: If the scale registers more than 100; turn the screw in a clockwise position. If the scale registers less than 100, it is necessary to unwind the screw anticlockwise. Repeat the process until the balance is adjusted (adjusting the zero and the sensitivity).Type of mass Capacity\nSimple pieces \n 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 g \n100, 200 and 500 g \nFractional pieces \n 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 mg \n100, 200 and 500 mg \nMass\nPlate\nFlexible\nConnections\nSupport ColumnFGFigure 10.

The \ncentrifuge is designed to use the centrifugal force generated in rotational movements to separate the constitutive elements of a mixture. There is a wide range of centrifuges capable of serving specifi  c industry and research needs. This \nchapter focuses on standing centrifuges normally used in public health and clinical laboratories. PHOTOGRAPH OF CENTRIFUGEPURPOSE OF THE CENTRIFUGE\nThe centrifuge uses centrifugal force (the force generated \nwhen an objec t rotates around a single point), for separating \nsolids suspended in a liquid by sedimentation, or liquids of diverse density. The rotational movements allow forces much greater than gravity to be generated in controlled periods of time. In the laboratory, centrifuges are generally used in processes such as the separation of solid components from biological liquids through sedimentation and in particular of blood components: red cells, white cells, platelets among others and for conducting multiple tests and treatments.There are several kinds of centrifuges. The most widely used in public health, surveillance and clinical laboratories are the table-top centrifuge, the ultracentrifuge, the haeamatocrit centrifuge and the standing centrifuge. OPERATION PRINCIPLES \nCentrifuges represent a practical application of Newton\u2019s law of motion. When a body of mass [m] turns around \na central point [O], it is subjected to a centripetal  force \n[N] directed towards the rotation axis with a magnitude N = m\u03c9\n2R, where [m] is the mass of the body, [R] is the radius \nand \u03c9 is the angular speed. Centrifuges possess a rotating axis on which is mounted a rotor with sample receiving compartments. Tangential speed is defi  ned by the following \nequation: VT=\u03c9R. Photo courtesy of Beckman CoulterCHAPTER 7  CENTRIFUGE\n46When the system spins at a speed of \u03c9 radians per second, \nthe samples are subjected to the centrifugal force Fp of the \nsame magnitude as N, but in an opposite direction. The \nfi gure shown below1 features a diagram of the concept, \nof its actual application and of the obtained result. This Fp force acts on particles in the substance centrifuged, \ncausing them to separate as a result of diff  erences in density. Denser particles will settle at the bottom of the tube in shorter periods of time, while lighter ones require longer periods of time, settling onto those of greater density. The relationship between the centrifugal acceleration [\u03c9\n2r ] to a \ngiven radius [r] and the force of gravity [g] is known as the relative centrifugal fi  eld or [RCF]\n2.

A measuring device known as \u201cload cell\u201d produces an \nexit signal corresponding to the load\u2019s force in the form of changes in the voltage or frequency. 3. A digital analogous electronic circuit shows the fi  nal \nresult of the weight digitally. Laboratory balances operate according to the principle \nof compensation of the electromagnetic force applicable to displacements or torques. The combination of their mechanical components and automatic reading systems provides weight measurements at defi  ned levels of accuracy \ndepending on the model. Principle. The mobile parts (weighing plate, support \ncolumn [a], bobbin, position and load indicator [G] -the object in the process of being weighed-) are maintained in equilibrium by a compensation force [F] equal to the weight. The compensation force is generated by an electrical current through a bobbin in the air gap of a cylindrical electromagnet. The force F is calculated with the equation [F = I x L x B] where: I = electrical intensity, L = total length of the wire of the coil and B = magnetic fl  ow intensity in the \nelectromagnet\u2019s air gap.With any change in the load (weight\/mass), the mobile \nmechanical system responds by moving vertically a fraction of distance. Detected by a photosensor [e], an electrical signal is sent to the servo-amplifi  er [f]. This changes the \nfl ow of electrical current passing through the bobbin of the \nmagnet [c] in such a manner that the mobile system returns to the balanced position upon adjusting of the magnetic fl ow in the electromagnet. Consequently, the weight of \nthe mass [G] can be measured indirectly at the start of the electrical current fl  ow, which passes through the circuit \nmeasuring the voltage [V] by means of a precision resistor [R], [V = I x R]. To date, many systems developed use the electronic system for carrying out very exact measurements of mass and weight. The following diagram explains how electronic balances function.

The signal process comprises the following functions:1. Tare setting. This setting is used to adjust the reading \nvalue at zero with any load within the balance\u2019s capacity range. It is controlled by a button generally located on the front part of the balance. It is commonly used for taring the weighing container. 2. Repeatability setting control. During a reading, weighed \nvalues are averaged within a predefi  ned period of time. This function is very useful when weighing operations need to be carried out in unstable conditions, e.g. in the presence of air currents or vibrations. This control defi nes the time period allowed for a result to lie within \npreset limits for it to be considered stable. In addition, it can be adjusted to suit a particular application.<\/DOCUMENT>\nWhat type of connections must be nearby for the cabinet?

OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThe biological safety cabinet is a chamber generally constructed of steel. It has a front glass window of adjustable \nheight, a ventilation system with an electrical motor, a ventilator and a set of ducts which while functioning, generate a negative pressure condition inside the cabinet. This forces the air to fl  ow from inside the cabinet through \nthe front opening to generate a curtain of air protecting the operator. Internally, the air is conducted through a series of grids and ducts to be finally treated in HEPA\n1  \nfi lters. Depending on the design of the cabinet, the air is \nrecycled inside the laboratory or extracted and renewed in diverse proportions. The air fl  ow, which in Class II cabinets \nmoves from the fi  lter towards the work surface, is laminar. A \nsummary of the existing type of cabinets and their principal characteristics is presented next. 1 HEPA: High Effi   ciency Particulate Air.

Measurement of the concentration of the hydrogen ion (H+) given in moles per litre (M) in a solution. The pH concept was proposed by S\u00f8rensen and Lindstr\u00f8m-\nLang in 1909 to facilitate expressing very low ion concentrations. It is defi  ned by the following equation:pH = \u2013log [H\n+]      or      [H+] = 10-pH \nIt measures the acidity of a solution. Example, in water the concentration of [H+] is 1.0 x 10-7 M resulting in pH = 7. This allows the range of concentrations from \n1 to 10-14 M, to be expressed from zero (0) to 14. There are diverse systems for measuring the acidity of a solution. An acidic substance  dissolved in water is capable \nof producing H+ ions. A basic substance dissolved in water is capable of producing [OH\u2013] (hydroxides) ions. An acid substance has a greater quantity of ions [H+] than pure water; a basic substance shows greater quantities of ions [OH\u2013] than pure water. The concentrations \nof substances are expressed in moles per litre. In pure water, the ion concentration [H+] and [OH\u2013] is 1.0 x 10\u20137 M, it is thus considered a neutral substance.

If this is the case, invert the plate (180\u00b0) and repeat the reading to rule out that diff  erences are \nattributed to the plate itself. In general, it is accepted that the instrument does not need further calibration if the plate results are as expected at two wavelengths. 3. Verify if the reader requires calibration. If so, proceed \nwith the calibration following the routine outlined by the manufacturer, verifying that the reading\u2019s linearity is maintained as rigorously as possible. 4. If the instrument does not have a calibration plate, verify \nit by placing a coloured solution in the wells of a plate and immediately carry out a complete reading. Then invert the plate 180\u00b0 and read the plate again. If both readings display identical, average values in each row, the reader is calibrated. 5. Verify that the reader is calibrated, column by column. Place a clean, empty plate and carry out a reading. If there is no diff  erence between each of the average \nreading of the fi  rst to the last column, it can be assumed \nthat the reader is calibrated.

The water distiller, also called distillation unit or water still, used in the laboratory, purifi  es running water by means of controlled \nvaporization and cooling processes. Upon applying thermal energy to water in a liquid phase by a warming process, it is changed into vapour. This allows the water molecules to separate from the molecules of other substances mixed or diluted. The water vapour is collected and passed through a condenser, where it is cooled and returned to the liquid phase. Then, the condensed water is collected into a diff  erent storage tank. Distilled water shows pure \ncharacteristics compared to running water; it is practically free of contaminating substances.PURPOSE OF THE WATER DISTILLER\nThe water distiller facilitates obtaining very pure water from potable wat er normally provided by the aqueduct services \nin urban centres. Distilled water is characterized by a lack of solids in suspension. It is used in multiple applications in centres which provide health services, especially in laboratory units, in washing, sterilization and dietetics. The more specialized the procedures are in the laboratory, the greater will be the level of purity required. For example: the preparation of reagents or biological material requires water of the highest quality. Distillation is one of the fundamental processes to achieve this (although it may not be the only one required). Water used in laboratories must be free of pyrogens, with a concentration of total solids no greater than 1 ppm, a pH value between 5.4 and 7.2 and an electrical resistance of at least 3 x 10\n5 ohm\/cm at 25 \u00b0C1. 1 Warming cabinets, sterilizers, and associated equipment , Division 11\u2013 \nEquipment, USACE\/NAVFAC\/ AFCESA, UFGS-11710, July 2003.

It must be taken into account that the weight is the force which the gravitational fi  eld exercises on a body\u2019s mass, this force being the product of the mass \nby the local acceleration of gravity [F = m x g]. The term local is used to emphasize that this acceleration depends on factors such as the geographical latitude, altitude and the Earth\u2019s density where the measurement is taken. This force is measured in Newtons.

In the laboratory, the balance is used \nfor weighing as part of quality control activities (on devices like pipettes), in the preparation of mixtures of components in predefined proportions and in the determination of specifi  c densities or weights. OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThere are diff  erences in design, principles and criteria of \nmetrology amongst balances. At present, there are two large groups of balances: mechanical and electronic balances. Mechanical balances \nThe following are some of the more common ones: 1. Spring balance. Its function is based on a mechanical \nproperty of springs as the force exercised on a spring is proportional to the spring\u2019s elasticity constant [k], multiplied by its elongation [x] [F = -kx]. The greater the mass [m] placed on the balance\u2019s plate, the greater the elongation will be, given that the elongation is proportional to the mass and the spring\u2019s constant. The calibration of a spring balance depends on the force of gravity acting on the object weighed. This type of balance is used when great precision is not necessary. 2. Sliding weight balance. This type of balance is \nequipped with two known weights which can be moved on setting scales (one macro, the other micro). Upon placing a substance of unknown mass on the tray, its weight is determined by moving the weight on both setting scales until the equilibrium position is reached. At this point, the weight is obtained by adding both quantities indicated by the sliding masses\u2019 position on the scale. 3. Analytical balance. This balance functions by comparing \nknown weight masses with that of a substance of unknown weight. It is composed of a base on a bar or symmetrical lever, maintained by a blade-like support on a central point called a fulcrum. At its ends, there are stirrups, also supported with blades which allow these to oscillate smoothly. From there, two plates are suspended. Certifi  ed weights are placed on one \nof the plates and unknown weights on the other. The balance has a securing system or lock, which allows the main lever to remain stable when not in use or when it is necessary to modify the counter-weights. The balance is inside an external box which protects it from interferences, such as air currents. Analytical balances can weigh ten thousandths of a gram (0.0001 g) or 100 thousandths of a gram (0.00001 g). This type of balance generally has a capacity of up to 200 grams.

Analytical balance  MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n23It is necessary to have a set of certifi  ed masses. The set is \ngenerally composed of the following pieces:\n4. Upper plate balance (Top loading or parallel guidance \nbalance). This type of balance has a loading plate located \non its upper part, supported by a column maintained in a vertical position by two pairs of guides with fl  exible \nconnections. The eff  ect of the force produced by the \nmass is transmitted from a point on the vertical column directly or by some mechanical means to the loading cell. The requirement with this type of mechanism is that parallel guides must be maintained with exactitude of up to \u00b1 1  \u00b5m. Deviations in parallelism cause an error known \nas lateral load (when the mass being weighed shows diff erences if the reading is taken at the centre of the \nplate or on one of its sides). The diagram shown below explains the operation principle some manufacturers have introduced in electronic balances.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>This will prevent the cabinet from releasing contaminants.

According to the \ntype of rotor being used and procedure conducted, these programs control the centrifugation time, the required temperature, the rotor\u2019s revolutions, the acceleration and deceleration, alarms warning the operator about any anomaly during operation. Manufacturers have also incorporated induction motors \n(without brushes) in centrifuges.

This information, along with good use and care, helps to maintain laboratory equipment in optimal condition.MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n1The microplate reader also known as \u201cPhotometric \nmicro-plate reader or ELISA reader\u201d is a specialized spectrophotometer designed to read results of the ELISA test, a technique used to determine the presence of antibodies or specifi  c antigens in samples. The technique \nis based on the detection of an antigen or antibodies captured on a solid surface using direct or secondary, labelled antibodies, producing a reaction whose product can be read by the spectrophotometer. The word ELISA is the acronym for \u201cEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay\u201d . This chapter covers the use of microplate readers for ELISA testing. For additional information on the instrument principles of operation and maintenance, consult Chapter 11 discussing the spectrophotometer. PHOTOGRAPH OF MICROPLATE READER\nPURPOSE OF THE MICROPLATE READER\nThe microplate reader is used for reading the results of ELISA \ntests. This technique has a direct application in immunology and serology. Among other applications it confi  rms the \npresence of antibodies or antigens of an infectious agent in an organism, antibodies from a vaccine or auto-antibodies, for example in rheumatoid arthritis.OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThe microplate reader is a specialized spectrophotometer. Unlike the c onventional spectrophotometer which facilitates \nreadings on a wide range of wavelengths, the microplate reader has filters or diffraction gratings that limit the wavelength range to that used in ELISA, generally between 400 to 750 nm (nanometres). Some readers operate in the ultraviolet range and carry out analyses between 340 to 700 nm. The optical system exploited by many manufacturers uses optic fi  bres to supply light to the microplate wells \ncontaining the samples. The light beam, passing through the sample has a diameter ranging between 1 to 3 mm. A detection system detects the light coming from the sample, amplifi  es the signal and determines the sample\u2019s \nabsorbance. A reading system converts it into data allowing the test result interpretation. Some microplate readers use double beam light systems. Test samples are located in specially designed plates with \na specifi  c number of wells where the procedure or test is \ncarried out. Plates of 8 columns by 12 rows with a total of 96 wells are common. There are also plates with a greater number of wells. For specialized applications, the current trend is to increase the number of wells (384-well plates) to reduce the amount of reagents and samples used and a greater throughput. The location of the optical sensors of the microplate reader varies depending on the manufacturers: these can be located above the sample plate, or directly underneath the plate\u2019s wells. Nowadays microplate readers have controls regulated by \nmicroprocessors; connection interfaces to information systems; quality and process control programs, which by means of a computer, allow complete test automation.Chapter 1\nMicroplate Reader\nGMDN Code 37036\nECRI Code 16-979\nDenomination Photometric micro-plate reader\nPhoto courtesy of BioRad Laboratories CHAPTER 1  MICROPLATE READER\n2Equipment required for ELISA testing\nIn order to perform the ELISA technique, the following \nequipment is r equired:  \n1.

The reference electrode is usually made of the same type of material as the internal electrode. Both tubes, interior and exterior, contain a reference solution. Only the outer tube has contact with the measured solution through a porous cap which acts as a saline bridge. This device acts like a galvanized cell. The reference electrode \nis the internal tube of the pH meter probe, which cannot lose ions through interactions with the surrounding environment. Therefore as a reference, it remains static (unchangeable) during the measuring process. The external tube of the probe contains the medium which is allowed  to mix with the external environment. As a result, this tube must be fi lled periodically with a potassium chloride solution (KCI) \nfor restoring the capacity of the electrode which would otherwise be inhibited by a loss of ions and evaporation. The glass bulb on the lower part of the pH electrode acts \nas a measuring element and is covered with a layer of hydrated gel on its exterior and interior. Metallic sodium cations [Na\n+] are diff  used in the hydrated gel outside of \nthe glass and in the solution, while the hydrogen ions [H+] \nare diff  used in the gel. This gel makes the pH electrode \nion-selective:  Hydrogen ions [H+] cannot pass through the \nglass membrane of the pH electrode. Sodium ions [Na+] pass \nthrough and cause a change in free energy, which the pH meter measures. A brief explanation of the theory on how electrodes function is included in the appendix at the end of the chapter.pH METER COMPONENTS \nA pH meter generally has the following components: 1. The body of the instrument containing the circuits, \ncontrols, connectors, display screens and measuring scales. The following are among some of its most \nimportant components:\na) An ON and OFF switch. Not all pH meters have an \non and off   switch. Some simply have a cord with a \nplug which allows it to be connected to a suitable electrical outlet. b) Temperature control. This control allows \nadjustments according to the temperature of the solution measured. c) Calibration controls. Depending on the design, \npH meters possess one or two calibration buttons or dials. Normally these are identifi  ed by Cal 1  and \nCal 2 . If the pH meter is calibrated using only one \nsolution, the Cal 1 button is used; making sure that Cal 2 is set at a 100%. If the pH meter allows  two point calibrations, two known pH solutions covering the range of pH to be measured are used. In this case, the two controls are used (Cal 1 and Cal 2). In special cases, a three-point calibration must be done (using three known pH solutions). d) Mode selector.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Cleaning oil and grease. Rinse the pH electrode with \na mild detergent or with methyl alcohol. Rinse with water.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>2. A measuring device known as \u201cload cell\u201d produces an \nexit signal corresponding to the load\u2019s force in the form of changes in the voltage or frequency. 3. A digital analogous electronic circuit shows the fi  nal \nresult of the weight digitally. Laboratory balances operate according to the principle \nof compensation of the electromagnetic force applicable to displacements or torques. The combination of their mechanical components and automatic reading systems provides weight measurements at defi  ned levels of accuracy \ndepending on the model. Principle. The mobile parts (weighing plate, support \ncolumn [a], bobbin, position and load indicator [G] -the object in the process of being weighed-) are maintained in equilibrium by a compensation force [F] equal to the weight. The compensation force is generated by an electrical current through a bobbin in the air gap of a cylindrical electromagnet. The force F is calculated with the equation [F = I x L x B] where: I = electrical intensity, L = total length of the wire of the coil and B = magnetic fl  ow intensity in the \nelectromagnet\u2019s air gap.With any change in the load (weight\/mass), the mobile \nmechanical system responds by moving vertically a fraction of distance. Detected by a photosensor [e], an electrical signal is sent to the servo-amplifi  er [f]. This changes the \nfl ow of electrical current passing through the bobbin of the \nmagnet [c] in such a manner that the mobile system returns to the balanced position upon adjusting of the magnetic fl ow in the electromagnet. Consequently, the weight of \nthe mass [G] can be measured indirectly at the start of the electrical current fl  ow, which passes through the circuit \nmeasuring the voltage [V] by means of a precision resistor [R], [V = I x R]. To date, many systems developed use the electronic system for carrying out very exact measurements of mass and weight. The following diagram explains how electronic balances function.

Compensation force principle  \nMAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n25The signal processing system\nThe signal processing system is composed of the circuit which \ntransf orms the electrical signal emitted by the transducer \ninto numerical data which can be read on a screen. The signal process comprises the following functions:1. Tare setting. This setting is used to adjust the reading \nvalue at zero with any load within the balance\u2019s capacity range. It is controlled by a button generally located on the front part of the balance. It is commonly used for taring the weighing container. 2. Repeatability setting control. During a reading, weighed \nvalues are averaged within a predefi  ned period of time. This function is very useful when weighing operations need to be carried out in unstable conditions, e.g. in the presence of air currents or vibrations. This control defi nes the time period allowed for a result to lie within \npreset limits for it to be considered stable. In addition, it can be adjusted to suit a particular application.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>The sum of all the balance\u2019s errors. This is called total error band . Hysteresis. The diff  erence in the results when the load in the balance is increased or decreased. Lateral load. A balance\u2019s ability to consistently read the value of masses, no matter where they are placed on the weighing scale. This is a lso called corner load. Lateral load error. A deviation in the results when an object is weighed placing it in diff  erent parts of the weighing plate, i.e. in the centre o f the plate and on \none of its sides. Linear error. A diff  erence showed when the balance is loaded in a successive manner, increasing the quantity of weight in equal magnitude un til it reaches its \nmaximum capacity and unloaded in an analogous process. The diff  erences shown between the readings obtained and the arithmetic v alues corresponding to the \nweights used are interpreted as non-linearity. Linearity. Refers to the ability of a balance to perform  accurate readings of weights throughout its weighing capacity . A graph showing  weight compared to the \nweight indication on a perfectly linear balance should generate a straight line. In order to determine the linear error of a ba lance, certifi  ed masses must be used. The procedure allows the linear diff  erences to be calculated by reading certifi  ed masses with and without preloading. The diff  e rence between the readings allows \nthe linear error to be calculated. Mass. A physical property of the bodies related to the quantity of matter, expressed in kilograms (kg), these contain. In physics, t here are two quantities to which \nthe name mass is given: gravitational mass  which is a measure of the way a body interacts with the gravitational fi  eld (if the body\u2019s mass is small, the body \nexperiences a weaker force than if its mass were greater) and the inertial mass , which is a quantitative or numerical measure of a body\u2019s inertia, that is, of its \nresistance to acceleration.

OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThe biological safety cabinet is a chamber generally constructed of steel. It has a front glass window of adjustable \nheight, a ventilation system with an electrical motor, a ventilator and a set of ducts which while functioning, generate a negative pressure condition inside the cabinet. This forces the air to fl  ow from inside the cabinet through \nthe front opening to generate a curtain of air protecting the operator. Internally, the air is conducted through a series of grids and ducts to be finally treated in HEPA\n1  \nfi lters.

The resistance is calculated by the following equation:\nR=k\u00d7l\na\nWhere: \nk  = constant that depends on the units employed \nl  = Length of the conductor a  = sectional area of the conductor \nThe ohm (\u03a9) is the common unit of electrical resistance; one ohm is equal to one volt per ampere.MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n35Chapter 6\nBiological Safety Cabinet\nThis equipment is designed for controlling aerosols and \nmicroparticles associated with managing potentially toxic or infectious biological material in laboratories in activities such as agitation, centrifugation, pipetting, and opening of pressurized containers.

It must be taken into account that the weight is the force which the gravitational fi  eld exercises on a body\u2019s mass, this force being the product of the mass \nby the local acceleration of gravity [F = m x g]. The term local is used to emphasize that this acceleration depends on factors such as the geographical latitude, altitude and the Earth\u2019s density where the measurement is taken. This force is measured in Newtons.

In the laboratory, the balance is used \nfor weighing as part of quality control activities (on devices like pipettes), in the preparation of mixtures of components in predefined proportions and in the determination of specifi  c densities or weights. OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThere are diff  erences in design, principles and criteria of \nmetrology amongst balances. At present, there are two large groups of balances: mechanical and electronic balances. Mechanical balances \nThe following are some of the more common ones: 1. Spring balance. Its function is based on a mechanical \nproperty of springs as the force exercised on a spring is proportional to the spring\u2019s elasticity constant [k], multiplied by its elongation [x] [F = -kx]. The greater the mass [m] placed on the balance\u2019s plate, the greater the elongation will be, given that the elongation is proportional to the mass and the spring\u2019s constant. The calibration of a spring balance depends on the force of gravity acting on the object weighed. This type of balance is used when great precision is not necessary. 2. Sliding weight balance. This type of balance is \nequipped with two known weights which can be moved on setting scales (one macro, the other micro). Upon placing a substance of unknown mass on the tray, its weight is determined by moving the weight on both setting scales until the equilibrium position is reached. At this point, the weight is obtained by adding both quantities indicated by the sliding masses\u2019 position on the scale. 3. Analytical balance. This balance functions by comparing \nknown weight masses with that of a substance of unknown weight. It is composed of a base on a bar or symmetrical lever, maintained by a blade-like support on a central point called a fulcrum. At its ends, there are stirrups, also supported with blades which allow these to oscillate smoothly. From there, two plates are suspended. Certifi  ed weights are placed on one \nof the plates and unknown weights on the other. The balance has a securing system or lock, which allows the main lever to remain stable when not in use or when it is necessary to modify the counter-weights. The balance is inside an external box which protects it from interferences, such as air currents. Analytical balances can weigh ten thousandths of a gram (0.0001 g) or 100 thousandths of a gram (0.00001 g). This type of balance generally has a capacity of up to 200 grams.

Analytical balance  MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n23It is necessary to have a set of certifi  ed masses. The set is \ngenerally composed of the following pieces:\n4. Upper plate balance (Top loading or parallel guidance \nbalance). This type of balance has a loading plate located \non its upper part, supported by a column maintained in a vertical position by two pairs of guides with fl  exible \nconnections. The eff  ect of the force produced by the \nmass is transmitted from a point on the vertical column directly or by some mechanical means to the loading cell. The requirement with this type of mechanism is that parallel guides must be maintained with exactitude of up to \u00b1 1  \u00b5m. Deviations in parallelism cause an error known \nas lateral load (when the mass being weighed shows diff erences if the reading is taken at the centre of the \nplate or on one of its sides). The diagram shown below explains the operation principle some manufacturers have introduced in electronic balances.<\/DOCUMENT>\n3. Which disinfectant is recommended for decontaminating surfaces?

The reference electrode is usually made of the same type of material as the internal electrode. Both tubes, interior and exterior, contain a reference solution. Only the outer tube has contact with the measured solution through a porous cap which acts as a saline bridge. This device acts like a galvanized cell. The reference electrode \nis the internal tube of the pH meter probe, which cannot lose ions through interactions with the surrounding environment. Therefore as a reference, it remains static (unchangeable) during the measuring process. The external tube of the probe contains the medium which is allowed  to mix with the external environment. As a result, this tube must be fi lled periodically with a potassium chloride solution (KCI) \nfor restoring the capacity of the electrode which would otherwise be inhibited by a loss of ions and evaporation. The glass bulb on the lower part of the pH electrode acts \nas a measuring element and is covered with a layer of hydrated gel on its exterior and interior.

This gel makes the pH electrode \nion-selective:  Hydrogen ions [H+] cannot pass through the \nglass membrane of the pH electrode.

The body of the instrument containing the circuits, \ncontrols, connectors, display screens and measuring scales. The following are among some of its most \nimportant components:\na) An ON and OFF switch. Not all pH meters have an \non and off   switch. Some simply have a cord with a \nplug which allows it to be connected to a suitable electrical outlet. b) Temperature control. This control allows \nadjustments according to the temperature of the solution measured. c) Calibration controls. Depending on the design, \npH meters possess one or two calibration buttons or dials. Normally these are identifi  ed by Cal 1  and \nCal 2 . If the pH meter is calibrated using only one \nsolution, the Cal 1 button is used; making sure that Cal 2 is set at a 100%. If the pH meter allows  two point calibrations, two known pH solutions covering the range of pH to be measured are used. In this case, the two controls are used (Cal 1 and Cal 2). In special cases, a three-point calibration must be done (using three known pH solutions). d) Mode selector.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Filtration system: Two HEPA fi  lters.5.

The technique \nis based on the detection of an antigen or antibodies captured on a solid surface using direct or secondary, labelled antibodies, producing a reaction whose product can be read by the spectrophotometer. The word ELISA is the acronym for \u201cEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay\u201d . This chapter covers the use of microplate readers for ELISA testing. For additional information on the instrument principles of operation and maintenance, consult Chapter 11 discussing the spectrophotometer. PHOTOGRAPH OF MICROPLATE READER\nPURPOSE OF THE MICROPLATE READER\nThe microplate reader is used for reading the results of ELISA \ntests. This technique has a direct application in immunology and serology. Among other applications it confi  rms the \npresence of antibodies or antigens of an infectious agent in an organism, antibodies from a vaccine or auto-antibodies, for example in rheumatoid arthritis.OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThe microplate reader is a specialized spectrophotometer. Unlike the c onventional spectrophotometer which facilitates \nreadings on a wide range of wavelengths, the microplate reader has filters or diffraction gratings that limit the wavelength range to that used in ELISA, generally between 400 to 750 nm (nanometres). Some readers operate in the ultraviolet range and carry out analyses between 340 to 700 nm. The optical system exploited by many manufacturers uses optic fi  bres to supply light to the microplate wells \ncontaining the samples. The light beam, passing through the sample has a diameter ranging between 1 to 3 mm. A detection system detects the light coming from the sample, amplifi  es the signal and determines the sample\u2019s \nabsorbance. A reading system converts it into data allowing the test result interpretation. Some microplate readers use double beam light systems. Test samples are located in specially designed plates with \na specifi  c number of wells where the procedure or test is \ncarried out. Plates of 8 columns by 12 rows with a total of 96 wells are common. There are also plates with a greater number of wells. For specialized applications, the current trend is to increase the number of wells (384-well plates) to reduce the amount of reagents and samples used and a greater throughput. The location of the optical sensors of the microplate reader varies depending on the manufacturers: these can be located above the sample plate, or directly underneath the plate\u2019s wells. Nowadays microplate readers have controls regulated by \nmicroprocessors; connection interfaces to information systems; quality and process control programs, which by means of a computer, allow complete test automation.Chapter 1\nMicroplate Reader\nGMDN Code 37036\nECRI Code 16-979\nDenomination Photometric micro-plate reader\nPhoto courtesy of BioRad Laboratories CHAPTER 1  MICROPLATE READER\n2Equipment required for ELISA testing\nIn order to perform the ELISA technique, the following \nequipment is r equired:  \n1.

It has a front glass window of adjustable \nheight, a ventilation system with an electrical motor, a ventilator and a set of ducts which while functioning, generate a negative pressure condition inside the cabinet. This forces the air to fl  ow from inside the cabinet through \nthe front opening to generate a curtain of air protecting the operator. Internally, the air is conducted through a series of grids and ducts to be finally treated in HEPA\n1  \nfi lters. Depending on the design of the cabinet, the air is \nrecycled inside the laboratory or extracted and renewed in diverse proportions. The air fl  ow, which in Class II cabinets \nmoves from the fi  lter towards the work surface, is laminar.

A process through which a fl  uid in liquid phase is heated until converted into vapour and then cooled and condensed back into liquid phase. The \ndistillation process is used for separating mixed substances, taking advantage of their diff  erence in volatility. To obtain ver y pure substances, consecutive distillation \ncycles are performed with the aim of progressively eliminating other substances present in the mix. Hardness (of water). A chemical characteristic of water determined by the carbonate, bicarbonate, chlorine, sulphate and occasionally calcium nitra te and \nmagnesium content. The resulting resistance is undesirable in some processes. There are two types of resistors in water. \u2022 Temporary hardness. This is determined by the magnesium and calcium carbonate and bicarbonate content. It may be eliminated by boiling the water a nd \nsubsequently fi  ltering out the precipitate. It is also known as carbonate resistance. \u2022 Permanent hardness. This is determined by all the calcium and magnesium salts, except the carbonates and bicarbonates. It cannot be eliminated by the \nboiling of water and it is also known as non-bicarbonate resistance.

Solution. A homogenous mix of two or more substances characterized by the absence of chemical reactions between the components of the li quid mixture. The \nliquid component which generally appears in greater proportion is called the solvent  and that found in a lesser quantity in solution, the solute .MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n59Chapter 9\nDilutor\nThe dilutor is used for diluting substances. Dilute comes \nfrom the Latin word diluere  and means to add liquid to a \nsolution. Solutions are defi  ned as homogeneous mixtures \nof two or more components which may be gaseous, liquid or solid. To dilute is to reduce the strength of a fl uid in a solvent, generally water. The dilutor facilitates \nthe preparation of liquid mixtures, until these achieve a proportion (concentration) suitable for use in different diagnostic processes. The identification of this type of equipment is generalized using the word dilutor.

Place electrodes in the calibration solution. 2.1 Submerge the electrode in the standardization \nsolution in such a manner that its lower extremity does not touch the bottom of the beaker. This decreases the risk of breaking the electrode. If the test requires that the solution be kept in motion using the magnetic agitator, special care must be taken so that the agitation rod does not hit the electrode as this could break it. Buff  er solution \nis used as a calibration solution, because its pH is known and therefore will still be maintained even if a little contamination occurs.

The technique \nis based on the detection of an antigen or antibodies captured on a solid surface using direct or secondary, labelled antibodies, producing a reaction whose product can be read by the spectrophotometer. The word ELISA is the acronym for \u201cEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay\u201d . This chapter covers the use of microplate readers for ELISA testing. For additional information on the instrument principles of operation and maintenance, consult Chapter 11 discussing the spectrophotometer. PHOTOGRAPH OF MICROPLATE READER\nPURPOSE OF THE MICROPLATE READER\nThe microplate reader is used for reading the results of ELISA \ntests. This technique has a direct application in immunology and serology. Among other applications it confi  rms the \npresence of antibodies or antigens of an infectious agent in an organism, antibodies from a vaccine or auto-antibodies, for example in rheumatoid arthritis.OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThe microplate reader is a specialized spectrophotometer. Unlike the c onventional spectrophotometer which facilitates \nreadings on a wide range of wavelengths, the microplate reader has filters or diffraction gratings that limit the wavelength range to that used in ELISA, generally between 400 to 750 nm (nanometres). Some readers operate in the ultraviolet range and carry out analyses between 340 to 700 nm. The optical system exploited by many manufacturers uses optic fi  bres to supply light to the microplate wells \ncontaining the samples. The light beam, passing through the sample has a diameter ranging between 1 to 3 mm. A detection system detects the light coming from the sample, amplifi  es the signal and determines the sample\u2019s \nabsorbance. A reading system converts it into data allowing the test result interpretation. Some microplate readers use double beam light systems. Test samples are located in specially designed plates with \na specifi  c number of wells where the procedure or test is \ncarried out. Plates of 8 columns by 12 rows with a total of 96 wells are common. There are also plates with a greater number of wells. For specialized applications, the current trend is to increase the number of wells (384-well plates) to reduce the amount of reagents and samples used and a greater throughput. The location of the optical sensors of the microplate reader varies depending on the manufacturers: these can be located above the sample plate, or directly underneath the plate\u2019s wells. Nowadays microplate readers have controls regulated by \nmicroprocessors; connection interfaces to information systems; quality and process control programs, which by means of a computer, allow complete test automation.Chapter 1\nMicroplate Reader\nGMDN Code 37036\nECRI Code 16-979\nDenomination Photometric micro-plate reader\nPhoto courtesy of BioRad Laboratories CHAPTER 1  MICROPLATE READER\n2Equipment required for ELISA testing\nIn order to perform the ELISA technique, the following \nequipment is r equired:  \n1.

A measuring device known as \u201cload cell\u201d produces an \nexit signal corresponding to the load\u2019s force in the form of changes in the voltage or frequency. 3. A digital analogous electronic circuit shows the fi  nal \nresult of the weight digitally. Laboratory balances operate according to the principle \nof compensation of the electromagnetic force applicable to displacements or torques. The combination of their mechanical components and automatic reading systems provides weight measurements at defi  ned levels of accuracy \ndepending on the model. Principle. The mobile parts (weighing plate, support \ncolumn [a], bobbin, position and load indicator [G] -the object in the process of being weighed-) are maintained in equilibrium by a compensation force [F] equal to the weight. The compensation force is generated by an electrical current through a bobbin in the air gap of a cylindrical electromagnet. The force F is calculated with the equation [F = I x L x B] where: I = electrical intensity, L = total length of the wire of the coil and B = magnetic fl  ow intensity in the \nelectromagnet\u2019s air gap.With any change in the load (weight\/mass), the mobile \nmechanical system responds by moving vertically a fraction of distance. Detected by a photosensor [e], an electrical signal is sent to the servo-amplifi  er [f]. This changes the \nfl ow of electrical current passing through the bobbin of the \nmagnet [c] in such a manner that the mobile system returns to the balanced position upon adjusting of the magnetic fl ow in the electromagnet. Consequently, the weight of \nthe mass [G] can be measured indirectly at the start of the electrical current fl  ow, which passes through the circuit \nmeasuring the voltage [V] by means of a precision resistor [R], [V = I x R]. To date, many systems developed use the electronic system for carrying out very exact measurements of mass and weight. The following diagram explains how electronic balances function.

The signal process comprises the following functions:1. Tare setting. This setting is used to adjust the reading \nvalue at zero with any load within the balance\u2019s capacity range. It is controlled by a button generally located on the front part of the balance. It is commonly used for taring the weighing container. 2. Repeatability setting control. During a reading, weighed \nvalues are averaged within a predefi  ned period of time. This function is very useful when weighing operations need to be carried out in unstable conditions, e.g. in the presence of air currents or vibrations. This control defi nes the time period allowed for a result to lie within \npreset limits for it to be considered stable. In addition, it can be adjusted to suit a particular application.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>The responsibility for the interpretation and use of the  material lies with the reader.

Tubes \nTube care includes aspects such as fi  lling of the tubes, adequat e temperature selection, centrifugation speed \nlimitations, washing and sterilization. The principle recommendations are the following:1. Wash tubes, adaptors and other accessories by hand \nusing a 1:10 mild detergent solution in water and a soft textured brush (not metallic). Avoid using automatic dishwashers. 2. Avoid using alcohol and acetone since such liquids aff  ect \nthe structure of the tubes.

This is a balance with a single plate. An unknown mass is placed on the weighing plate. It is weighed by removing known masses from the counterweight side until it reaches a balanced position, using a mechanical system of cams. The fulcrum is generally off  -centre in relation to the length of the load \nbeam and located near the front of the balance. When a mass is placed on the weight plate and the balance\u2019s locking mechanism is released, the movement of the load beam is projected through an optical system to a screen located on the front part of the instrument. Operation veri\ufb01  cation\nThe procedure used for verifying the functioning of a typical \nmechanical balanc e is described below. The described \nprocess is based on the substitution balance.1. Verify that the balance is levelled. The levelling is \nachieved using a ring-shaped adjustment mechanism located on the base of the balance or by adjusting a bubble or knob on a scale located on the front of the balance\u2019s base. 2. Test the  zero mechanism. Place the controls on zero \nand free the balance. If the reading does not stay at zero, adjust the zero mechanism (a grooved screw located in a horizontal position near the fulcrum). To do this, it is necessary to block the balance and slightly adjust the mechanism. The process is to be continued until the zero adjusts correctly on the reading scale.3. Verify and adjust the sensitivity. This is always readjusted \nwhenever some internal adjustment is done. It is performed with a known standard according to the following steps:\na) Lock the balance.b) Place a standard weight (equivalent to the optical \nscale range) on the plate. c) Position the micro setting to one (1). d) Release the balance. e) Adjust to the zero position.f) Position the micro setting to zero (0). The balance \nshould indicate 100. If the scale displays less or more than 100, the sensitivity control must be adjusted. This requires locking the balance, opening the upper cover and turning the sensitivity screw: If the scale registers more than 100; turn the screw in a clockwise position. If the scale registers less than 100, it is necessary to unwind the screw anticlockwise. Repeat the process until the balance is adjusted (adjusting the zero and the sensitivity).Type of mass Capacity\nSimple pieces \n 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 g \n100, 200 and 500 g \nFractional pieces \n 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 mg \n100, 200 and 500 mg \nMass\nPlate\nFlexible\nConnections\nSupport ColumnFGFigure 10.

It must be taken into account that the weight is the force which the gravitational fi  eld exercises on a body\u2019s mass, this force being the product of the mass \nby the local acceleration of gravity [F = m x g]. The term local is used to emphasize that this acceleration depends on factors such as the geographical latitude, altitude and the Earth\u2019s density where the measurement is taken. This force is measured in Newtons.

In the laboratory, the balance is used \nfor weighing as part of quality control activities (on devices like pipettes), in the preparation of mixtures of components in predefined proportions and in the determination of specifi  c densities or weights. OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThere are diff  erences in design, principles and criteria of \nmetrology amongst balances. At present, there are two large groups of balances: mechanical and electronic balances. Mechanical balances \nThe following are some of the more common ones: 1. Spring balance. Its function is based on a mechanical \nproperty of springs as the force exercised on a spring is proportional to the spring\u2019s elasticity constant [k], multiplied by its elongation [x] [F = -kx]. The greater the mass [m] placed on the balance\u2019s plate, the greater the elongation will be, given that the elongation is proportional to the mass and the spring\u2019s constant. The calibration of a spring balance depends on the force of gravity acting on the object weighed. This type of balance is used when great precision is not necessary. 2. Sliding weight balance. This type of balance is \nequipped with two known weights which can be moved on setting scales (one macro, the other micro). Upon placing a substance of unknown mass on the tray, its weight is determined by moving the weight on both setting scales until the equilibrium position is reached. At this point, the weight is obtained by adding both quantities indicated by the sliding masses\u2019 position on the scale. 3. Analytical balance. This balance functions by comparing \nknown weight masses with that of a substance of unknown weight. It is composed of a base on a bar or symmetrical lever, maintained by a blade-like support on a central point called a fulcrum. At its ends, there are stirrups, also supported with blades which allow these to oscillate smoothly. From there, two plates are suspended. Certifi  ed weights are placed on one \nof the plates and unknown weights on the other. The balance has a securing system or lock, which allows the main lever to remain stable when not in use or when it is necessary to modify the counter-weights. The balance is inside an external box which protects it from interferences, such as air currents. Analytical balances can weigh ten thousandths of a gram (0.0001 g) or 100 thousandths of a gram (0.00001 g). This type of balance generally has a capacity of up to 200 grams.

Analytical balance  MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n23It is necessary to have a set of certifi  ed masses. The set is \ngenerally composed of the following pieces:\n4. Upper plate balance (Top loading or parallel guidance \nbalance). This type of balance has a loading plate located \non its upper part, supported by a column maintained in a vertical position by two pairs of guides with fl  exible \nconnections. The eff  ect of the force produced by the \nmass is transmitted from a point on the vertical column directly or by some mechanical means to the loading cell. The requirement with this type of mechanism is that parallel guides must be maintained with exactitude of up to \u00b1 1  \u00b5m. Deviations in parallelism cause an error known \nas lateral load (when the mass being weighed shows diff erences if the reading is taken at the centre of the \nplate or on one of its sides). The diagram shown below explains the operation principle some manufacturers have introduced in electronic balances.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Turn on the cabinet. Turn off   the UV lamp if lit.

Risk level 4 group  is composed of pathogens which \nusually produce very serious sicknesses in human beings or animals, frequently without treatments available. These agents are easily spread from one individual to another or from animal to human being or vice versa, directly or indirectly or by casual contact.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>On the outside and end of the inner tube is the anodized end. The reference electrode is usually made of the same type of material as the internal electrode. Both tubes, interior and exterior, contain a reference solution. Only the outer tube has contact with the measured solution through a porous cap which acts as a saline bridge. This device acts like a galvanized cell. The reference electrode \nis the internal tube of the pH meter probe, which cannot lose ions through interactions with the surrounding environment. Therefore as a reference, it remains static (unchangeable) during the measuring process. The external tube of the probe contains the medium which is allowed  to mix with the external environment. As a result, this tube must be fi lled periodically with a potassium chloride solution (KCI) \nfor restoring the capacity of the electrode which would otherwise be inhibited by a loss of ions and evaporation. The glass bulb on the lower part of the pH electrode acts \nas a measuring element and is covered with a layer of hydrated gel on its exterior and interior. Metallic sodium cations [Na\n+] are diff  used in the hydrated gel outside of \nthe glass and in the solution, while the hydrogen ions [H+] \nare diff  used in the gel. This gel makes the pH electrode \nion-selective:  Hydrogen ions [H+] cannot pass through the \nglass membrane of the pH electrode. Sodium ions [Na+] pass \nthrough and cause a change in free energy, which the pH meter measures. A brief explanation of the theory on how electrodes function is included in the appendix at the end of the chapter.pH METER COMPONENTS \nA pH meter generally has the following components: 1. The body of the instrument containing the circuits, \ncontrols, connectors, display screens and measuring scales. The following are among some of its most \nimportant components:\na) An ON and OFF switch. Not all pH meters have an \non and off   switch. Some simply have a cord with a \nplug which allows it to be connected to a suitable electrical outlet. b) Temperature control. This control allows \nadjustments according to the temperature of the solution measured. c) Calibration controls. Depending on the design, \npH meters possess one or two calibration buttons or dials. Normally these are identifi  ed by Cal 1  and \nCal 2 . If the pH meter is calibrated using only one \nsolution, the Cal 1 button is used; making sure that Cal 2 is set at a 100%. If the pH meter allows  two point calibrations, two known pH solutions covering the range of pH to be measured are used. In this case, the two controls are used (Cal 1 and Cal 2). In special cases, a three-point calibration must be done (using three known pH solutions). d) Mode selector.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Before moving the cabinet to a diff  erent location. 5.

Some manufacturers have incorporated controls with \nmicroprocessors. They vary depending on the type of bath. The diagram of a basic water bath\u2019s control panel is shown next. The control panel has these elements:\n1. The on and off   control switch\n2. A Menu button for selecting the operation\u2019s parameters: \noperation temperature, alarm temperature, temperature scale (\u00b0C, \u00b0F)\n3. Two buttons for parameter adjustment4. A screen 5. A pilot light6. Pilots (2) for identifying the temperature scale (\u00b0C, \u00b0F). WATER BATH OPERATION\nInstallation\n1. Install the water bath close to an electrical outlet. The \noutlet must ha ve its respective ground pole in order \nto guarantee the protection and safety of the operator and the equipment. Water baths generally operate at 120 V\/60 Hz or 230 V\/60Hz. Its installation and use is facilitated by a sink close by for supplying and draining of water. 2. Verify that the location selected is levelled and has the \nnecessary resistance to safely support the weight of the water bath when it is full of liquid. 3. Ensure that the location has a suitable amount of space \nfor putting the samples and the accessories required for the normal operation of the water bath. 4. Avoid placing the water bath where there are strong air \ncurrents which can interfere with its normal operation. For example: in front of an air-conditioning unit or window. Safety\n1. Avoid the use of the water bath in environments where \nther e are fl  ammable and combustible materials. The \nequipment has components (resistors generating very high temperatures) which could start an accidental fi  re \nor explosion. 2. Always connect the equipment to an electrical outlet \nwith a ground pole to protect the user and the equipment from electrical discharges. The electrical connection must comply with the required norms of the country and the laboratory. 3. Use the water bath exclusively with non-corrosive or \nnon-fl  ammable liquids. 4. Use personal protective elements when working with \nthe water bath. The bath has resistors which can cause burns if inadvertently touched, even a considerable time after turning off   the equipment. 5. When working with substances that generate vapours, \nplace the water bath under a chemical hood or in a well ventilated area. 6. Remember that liquids incubated in the water bath tank \ncan produce burns if hands are inadvertently placed inside it. 7. Take into account that the water bath is designed for \nuse with a liquid inside the tank. If the inside is dry, the temperature of the tank can become very high. Use the diff  using tray for placing the container inside of the \nfi lled tank of the water bath. This has been designed for \ndistributing the temperature in a uniform way. 8. Avoid using the water bath if any of its controls is not \nworking, e.g. the temperature or limit controls.Class Temperature range \nLow temperature  Room temperature up to 60 \u00b0C \nRoom temperature up to 100 \u00b0C\nHigh temperature Room temperature up to 275 \u00b0C. When it needs to \nreach temperatures above 100 \u00b0C, it is necessary to use fl  uids other than water as the boiling point of water is 100 \u00b0C under normal conditions\nThis type of bath generally uses oils which have much \nhigher boiling points. Insulated Room temperature up to 100 \u00b0C with accessories and\/\nor agitation systems (with water).<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>\u2022\u2022 For some equipment, additional themes related to calibration, qualit y control and design (with operational controls). This information, along with good use and care, helps to maintain laboratory equipment in optimal condition.MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n1The microplate reader also known as \u201cPhotometric \nmicro-plate reader or ELISA reader\u201d is a specialized spectrophotometer designed to read results of the ELISA test, a technique used to determine the presence of antibodies or specifi  c antigens in samples. The technique \nis based on the detection of an antigen or antibodies captured on a solid surface using direct or secondary, labelled antibodies, producing a reaction whose product can be read by the spectrophotometer. The word ELISA is the acronym for \u201cEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay\u201d . This chapter covers the use of microplate readers for ELISA testing. For additional information on the instrument principles of operation and maintenance, consult Chapter 11 discussing the spectrophotometer. PHOTOGRAPH OF MICROPLATE READER\nPURPOSE OF THE MICROPLATE READER\nThe microplate reader is used for reading the results of ELISA \ntests. This technique has a direct application in immunology and serology. Among other applications it confi  rms the \npresence of antibodies or antigens of an infectious agent in an organism, antibodies from a vaccine or auto-antibodies, for example in rheumatoid arthritis.OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThe microplate reader is a specialized spectrophotometer. Unlike the c onventional spectrophotometer which facilitates \nreadings on a wide range of wavelengths, the microplate reader has filters or diffraction gratings that limit the wavelength range to that used in ELISA, generally between 400 to 750 nm (nanometres). Some readers operate in the ultraviolet range and carry out analyses between 340 to 700 nm. The optical system exploited by many manufacturers uses optic fi  bres to supply light to the microplate wells \ncontaining the samples. The light beam, passing through the sample has a diameter ranging between 1 to 3 mm. A detection system detects the light coming from the sample, amplifi  es the signal and determines the sample\u2019s \nabsorbance. A reading system converts it into data allowing the test result interpretation. Some microplate readers use double beam light systems. Test samples are located in specially designed plates with \na specifi  c number of wells where the procedure or test is \ncarried out. Plates of 8 columns by 12 rows with a total of 96 wells are common. There are also plates with a greater number of wells. For specialized applications, the current trend is to increase the number of wells (384-well plates) to reduce the amount of reagents and samples used and a greater throughput. The location of the optical sensors of the microplate reader varies depending on the manufacturers: these can be located above the sample plate, or directly underneath the plate\u2019s wells. Nowadays microplate readers have controls regulated by \nmicroprocessors; connection interfaces to information systems; quality and process control programs, which by means of a computer, allow complete test automation.Chapter 1\nMicroplate Reader\nGMDN Code 37036\nECRI Code 16-979\nDenomination Photometric micro-plate reader\nPhoto courtesy of BioRad Laboratories CHAPTER 1  MICROPLATE READER\n2Equipment required for ELISA testing\nIn order to perform the ELISA technique, the following \nequipment is r equired:  \n1.

The mass in grams of this amount of a substance, numerically equal to the molecular weight of the substance, also called gram-molecular weight. pH. Measurement of the concentration of the hydrogen ion (H+) given in moles per litre (M) in a solution. The pH concept was proposed by S\u00f8rensen and Lindstr\u00f8m-\nLang in 1909 to facilitate expressing very low ion concentrations. It is defi  ned by the following equation:pH = \u2013log [H\n+]      or      [H+] = 10-pH \nIt measures the acidity of a solution. Example, in water the concentration of [H+] is 1.0 x 10-7 M resulting in pH = 7. This allows the range of concentrations from \n1 to 10-14 M, to be expressed from zero (0) to 14. There are diverse systems for measuring the acidity of a solution. An acidic substance  dissolved in water is capable \nof producing H+ ions. A basic substance dissolved in water is capable of producing [OH\u2013] (hydroxides) ions. An acid substance has a greater quantity of ions [H+] than pure water; a basic substance shows greater quantities of ions [OH\u2013] than pure water. The concentrations \nof substances are expressed in moles per litre. In pure water, the ion concentration [H+] and [OH\u2013] is 1.0 x 10\u20137 M, it is thus considered a neutral substance. In reality, it is a weak electrolyte that is dissociated \nfollowing the following equation:H\n2O  '  [H+][OH\u2013] \nIn all aqueous solutions there is a balance expressed as:   \n[H+][OH\u2013] = K \n     H2O\nIf the solution is diluted, the concentration of the non-dissociated water can be considered constant:\n[H+][OH\u2013] = [H2O]K = Ka\nThe new constant Ka is called a constant of dissociation or ionic product of water and its value is 1.0x10\u201314 at 25 \u00b0C.

Power:  Single phase Voltage: 110 V or 220-230 V Frequencies; \n50-60Hz depending on the World region. There is also portable pH meters powered with batteries. GENERAL CALIBRATION PROCEDURE\npH analyzers must be calibrated before use to guarantee \nthe qualit y and accuracy of the readings following these \nprocedures:1. One point calibration. This is carried out for normal \nworking conditions and for normal use. It uses one known pH reference solution. 2. Two point calibration. This is done prior to performing \nvery precise measurements. It uses two known pH reference solutions. It is also done if the instrument is used sporadically and its maintenance is not carried out frequently.Description of the process\nFrequency: Daily1. Calibr ate the pH meter using one known pH solution \n(one point calibration). 1.1 Connect the equipment to an electrical outlet with \nsuitable voltage. 1.2 A djust the temperature selector to the \nenvironmental temperature. 1.3 Adjust the meter.1.4 Remove the electrodes from the storage container. The electrodes must always be stored in a suitable solution. Some can be maintained in distilled water, others must be kept in a diff  erent solution \nas their manufacturers recommend\n1. If for some \nreason, the electrode becomes dry, it is necessary to soak it for at least 24 hours before use. 1.5 R inse the electrode with distilled water in an empty \nbeaker. 1.6 Dry the electrode with material able to absorb \nresidual liquid on its surface, without impregnating the electrode. To avoid possible contamination, the electrodes must be rinsed between diff  erent \nsolutions. 1 Verify the type of buff  er solution recommended by the electrode \nmanufacturer.MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n172. Place electrodes in the calibration solution. 2.1 Submerge the electrode in the standardization \nsolution in such a manner that its lower extremity does not touch the bottom of the beaker. This decreases the risk of breaking the electrode. If the test requires that the solution be kept in motion using the magnetic agitator, special care must be taken so that the agitation rod does not hit the electrode as this could break it. Buff  er solution \nis used as a calibration solution, because its pH is known and therefore will still be maintained even if a little contamination occurs. In general, a solution of pH = 7 is used for this purpose\n1.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Base5. Lid\/cover6. Casing 7. Electric motor8.

Measurement of the concentration of the hydrogen ion (H+) given in moles per litre (M) in a solution. The pH concept was proposed by S\u00f8rensen and Lindstr\u00f8m-\nLang in 1909 to facilitate expressing very low ion concentrations. It is defi  ned by the following equation:pH = \u2013log [H\n+]      or      [H+] = 10-pH \nIt measures the acidity of a solution. Example, in water the concentration of [H+] is 1.0 x 10-7 M resulting in pH = 7. This allows the range of concentrations from \n1 to 10-14 M, to be expressed from zero (0) to 14. There are diverse systems for measuring the acidity of a solution. An acidic substance  dissolved in water is capable \nof producing H+ ions. A basic substance dissolved in water is capable of producing [OH\u2013] (hydroxides) ions. An acid substance has a greater quantity of ions [H+] than pure water; a basic substance shows greater quantities of ions [OH\u2013] than pure water. The concentrations \nof substances are expressed in moles per litre. In pure water, the ion concentration [H+] and [OH\u2013] is 1.0 x 10\u20137 M, it is thus considered a neutral substance. In reality, it is a weak electrolyte that is dissociated \nfollowing the following equation:H\n2O  '  [H+][OH\u2013] \nIn all aqueous solutions there is a balance expressed as:   \n[H+][OH\u2013] = K \n     H2O\nIf the solution is diluted, the concentration of the non-dissociated water can be considered constant:\n[H+][OH\u2013] = [H2O]K = Ka\nThe new constant Ka is called a constant of dissociation or ionic product of water and its value is 1.0x10\u201314 at 25 \u00b0C.

It has a front glass window of adjustable \nheight, a ventilation system with an electrical motor, a ventilator and a set of ducts which while functioning, generate a negative pressure condition inside the cabinet. This forces the air to fl  ow from inside the cabinet through \nthe front opening to generate a curtain of air protecting the operator. Internally, the air is conducted through a series of grids and ducts to be finally treated in HEPA\n1  \nfi lters. Depending on the design of the cabinet, the air is \nrecycled inside the laboratory or extracted and renewed in diverse proportions. The air fl  ow, which in Class II cabinets \nmoves from the fi  lter towards the work surface, is laminar.

In the laboratory, the balance is used \nfor weighing as part of quality control activities (on devices like pipettes), in the preparation of mixtures of components in predefined proportions and in the determination of specifi  c densities or weights. OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThere are diff  erences in design, principles and criteria of \nmetrology amongst balances. At present, there are two large groups of balances: mechanical and electronic balances. Mechanical balances \nThe following are some of the more common ones: 1. Spring balance. Its function is based on a mechanical \nproperty of springs as the force exercised on a spring is proportional to the spring\u2019s elasticity constant [k], multiplied by its elongation [x] [F = -kx]. The greater the mass [m] placed on the balance\u2019s plate, the greater the elongation will be, given that the elongation is proportional to the mass and the spring\u2019s constant. The calibration of a spring balance depends on the force of gravity acting on the object weighed. This type of balance is used when great precision is not necessary. 2. Sliding weight balance. This type of balance is \nequipped with two known weights which can be moved on setting scales (one macro, the other micro). Upon placing a substance of unknown mass on the tray, its weight is determined by moving the weight on both setting scales until the equilibrium position is reached. At this point, the weight is obtained by adding both quantities indicated by the sliding masses\u2019 position on the scale. 3. Analytical balance. This balance functions by comparing \nknown weight masses with that of a substance of unknown weight. It is composed of a base on a bar or symmetrical lever, maintained by a blade-like support on a central point called a fulcrum. At its ends, there are stirrups, also supported with blades which allow these to oscillate smoothly. From there, two plates are suspended. Certifi  ed weights are placed on one \nof the plates and unknown weights on the other. The balance has a securing system or lock, which allows the main lever to remain stable when not in use or when it is necessary to modify the counter-weights. The balance is inside an external box which protects it from interferences, such as air currents. Analytical balances can weigh ten thousandths of a gram (0.0001 g) or 100 thousandths of a gram (0.00001 g). This type of balance generally has a capacity of up to 200 grams.

Analytical balance  MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n23It is necessary to have a set of certifi  ed masses. The set is \ngenerally composed of the following pieces:\n4. Upper plate balance (Top loading or parallel guidance \nbalance). This type of balance has a loading plate located \non its upper part, supported by a column maintained in a vertical position by two pairs of guides with fl  exible \nconnections. The eff  ect of the force produced by the \nmass is transmitted from a point on the vertical column directly or by some mechanical means to the loading cell. The requirement with this type of mechanism is that parallel guides must be maintained with exactitude of up to \u00b1 1  \u00b5m. Deviations in parallelism cause an error known \nas lateral load (when the mass being weighed shows diff erences if the reading is taken at the centre of the \nplate or on one of its sides). The diagram shown below explains the operation principle some manufacturers have introduced in electronic balances.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>To protect the environment. The cabinets are used for routine work related to pathogens \n(parasites, bacteria, virus, fungus), cell culture and under very precise conditions, the management of toxic agents. OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThe biological safety cabinet is a chamber generally constructed of steel. It has a front glass window of adjustable \nheight, a ventilation system with an electrical motor, a ventilator and a set of ducts which while functioning, generate a negative pressure condition inside the cabinet. This forces the air to fl  ow from inside the cabinet through \nthe front opening to generate a curtain of air protecting the operator. Internally, the air is conducted through a series of grids and ducts to be finally treated in HEPA\n1  \nfi lters. Depending on the design of the cabinet, the air is \nrecycled inside the laboratory or extracted and renewed in diverse proportions. The air fl  ow, which in Class II cabinets \nmoves from the fi  lter towards the work surface, is laminar. A \nsummary of the existing type of cabinets and their principal characteristics is presented next. 1 HEPA: High Effi   ciency Particulate Air.

The diff  erence in the results when the load in the balance is increased or decreased. Lateral load. A balance\u2019s ability to consistently read the value of masses, no matter where they are placed on the weighing scale. This is a lso called corner load. Lateral load error. A deviation in the results when an object is weighed placing it in diff  erent parts of the weighing plate, i.e. in the centre o f the plate and on \none of its sides. Linear error. A diff  erence showed when the balance is loaded in a successive manner, increasing the quantity of weight in equal magnitude un til it reaches its \nmaximum capacity and unloaded in an analogous process. The diff  erences shown between the readings obtained and the arithmetic v alues corresponding to the \nweights used are interpreted as non-linearity. Linearity. Refers to the ability of a balance to perform  accurate readings of weights throughout its weighing capacity . A graph showing  weight compared to the \nweight indication on a perfectly linear balance should generate a straight line. In order to determine the linear error of a ba lance, certifi  ed masses must be used. The procedure allows the linear diff  erences to be calculated by reading certifi  ed masses with and without preloading. The diff  e rence between the readings allows \nthe linear error to be calculated. Mass. A physical property of the bodies related to the quantity of matter, expressed in kilograms (kg), these contain. In physics, t here are two quantities to which \nthe name mass is given: gravitational mass  which is a measure of the way a body interacts with the gravitational fi  eld (if the body\u2019s mass is small, the body \nexperiences a weaker force than if its mass were greater) and the inertial mass , which is a quantitative or numerical measure of a body\u2019s inertia, that is, of its \nresistance to acceleration. The unit for expressing mass is the kilogram [kg].

It must be taken into account that the weight is the force which the gravitational fi  eld exercises on a body\u2019s mass, this force being the product of the mass \nby the local acceleration of gravity [F = m x g]. The term local is used to emphasize that this acceleration depends on factors such as the geographical latitude, altitude and the Earth\u2019s density where the measurement is taken. This force is measured in Newtons.

In the laboratory, the balance is used \nfor weighing as part of quality control activities (on devices like pipettes), in the preparation of mixtures of components in predefined proportions and in the determination of specifi  c densities or weights. OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThere are diff  erences in design, principles and criteria of \nmetrology amongst balances. At present, there are two large groups of balances: mechanical and electronic balances. Mechanical balances \nThe following are some of the more common ones: 1. Spring balance. Its function is based on a mechanical \nproperty of springs as the force exercised on a spring is proportional to the spring\u2019s elasticity constant [k], multiplied by its elongation [x] [F = -kx]. The greater the mass [m] placed on the balance\u2019s plate, the greater the elongation will be, given that the elongation is proportional to the mass and the spring\u2019s constant. The calibration of a spring balance depends on the force of gravity acting on the object weighed. This type of balance is used when great precision is not necessary. 2. Sliding weight balance. This type of balance is \nequipped with two known weights which can be moved on setting scales (one macro, the other micro). Upon placing a substance of unknown mass on the tray, its weight is determined by moving the weight on both setting scales until the equilibrium position is reached. At this point, the weight is obtained by adding both quantities indicated by the sliding masses\u2019 position on the scale. 3. Analytical balance. This balance functions by comparing \nknown weight masses with that of a substance of unknown weight. It is composed of a base on a bar or symmetrical lever, maintained by a blade-like support on a central point called a fulcrum. At its ends, there are stirrups, also supported with blades which allow these to oscillate smoothly. From there, two plates are suspended. Certifi  ed weights are placed on one \nof the plates and unknown weights on the other. The balance has a securing system or lock, which allows the main lever to remain stable when not in use or when it is necessary to modify the counter-weights. The balance is inside an external box which protects it from interferences, such as air currents. Analytical balances can weigh ten thousandths of a gram (0.0001 g) or 100 thousandths of a gram (0.00001 g). This type of balance generally has a capacity of up to 200 grams.

Analytical balance  MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n23It is necessary to have a set of certifi  ed masses. The set is \ngenerally composed of the following pieces:\n4. Upper plate balance (Top loading or parallel guidance \nbalance). This type of balance has a loading plate located \non its upper part, supported by a column maintained in a vertical position by two pairs of guides with fl  exible \nconnections. The eff  ect of the force produced by the \nmass is transmitted from a point on the vertical column directly or by some mechanical means to the loading cell. The requirement with this type of mechanism is that parallel guides must be maintained with exactitude of up to \u00b1 1  \u00b5m. Deviations in parallelism cause an error known \nas lateral load (when the mass being weighed shows diff erences if the reading is taken at the centre of the \nplate or on one of its sides).

A process through which a fl  uid in liquid phase is heated until converted into vapour and then cooled and condensed back into liquid phase. The \ndistillation process is used for separating mixed substances, taking advantage of their diff  erence in volatility. To obtain ver y pure substances, consecutive distillation \ncycles are performed with the aim of progressively eliminating other substances present in the mix. Hardness (of water). A chemical characteristic of water determined by the carbonate, bicarbonate, chlorine, sulphate and occasionally calcium nitra te and \nmagnesium content. The resulting resistance is undesirable in some processes. There are two types of resistors in water. \u2022 Temporary hardness. This is determined by the magnesium and calcium carbonate and bicarbonate content. It may be eliminated by boiling the water a nd \nsubsequently fi  ltering out the precipitate. It is also known as carbonate resistance. \u2022 Permanent hardness. This is determined by all the calcium and magnesium salts, except the carbonates and bicarbonates. It cannot be eliminated by the \nboiling of water and it is also known as non-bicarbonate resistance.

Solution. A homogenous mix of two or more substances characterized by the absence of chemical reactions between the components of the li quid mixture. The \nliquid component which generally appears in greater proportion is called the solvent  and that found in a lesser quantity in solution, the solute .MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n59Chapter 9\nDilutor\nThe dilutor is used for diluting substances. Dilute comes \nfrom the Latin word diluere  and means to add liquid to a \nsolution. Solutions are defi  ned as homogeneous mixtures \nof two or more components which may be gaseous, liquid or solid. To dilute is to reduce the strength of a fl uid in a solvent, generally water. The dilutor facilitates \nthe preparation of liquid mixtures, until these achieve a proportion (concentration) suitable for use in different diagnostic processes. The identification of this type of equipment is generalized using the word dilutor. DIAGRAM OF A DILUTORPURPOSE OF THE DILUTOR\nThe purpose of the dilutor is to prepare mixtures of \nsubstanc es to achieve determined concentrations and \nvolumes as done with a pipette, but with the advantage of an automated or programmed process.

A deviation in the results when an object is weighed placing it in diff  erent parts of the weighing plate, i.e. in the centre o f the plate and on \none of its sides. Linear error. A diff  erence showed when the balance is loaded in a successive manner, increasing the quantity of weight in equal magnitude un til it reaches its \nmaximum capacity and unloaded in an analogous process. The diff  erences shown between the readings obtained and the arithmetic v alues corresponding to the \nweights used are interpreted as non-linearity. Linearity. Refers to the ability of a balance to perform  accurate readings of weights throughout its weighing capacity . A graph showing  weight compared to the \nweight indication on a perfectly linear balance should generate a straight line. In order to determine the linear error of a ba lance, certifi  ed masses must be used. The procedure allows the linear diff  erences to be calculated by reading certifi  ed masses with and without preloading. The diff  e rence between the readings allows \nthe linear error to be calculated. Mass. A physical property of the bodies related to the quantity of matter, expressed in kilograms (kg), these contain. In physics, t here are two quantities to which \nthe name mass is given: gravitational mass  which is a measure of the way a body interacts with the gravitational fi  eld (if the body\u2019s mass is small, the body \nexperiences a weaker force than if its mass were greater) and the inertial mass , which is a quantitative or numerical measure of a body\u2019s inertia, that is, of its \nresistance to acceleration.

A quantity of any substance whose mass expressed in grams is numerically equal to its atomic mass. Mole (unit). The amount of a substance that contains as many atoms, molecules, ions, or other elementary units as the number of atoms in 0. 012 kilogram of \ncarbon 12. It corresponds to the number 6.0225 \u00d7 1023, or Avogadro\u2019s number, also called gram molecule. The mass in grams of this amount of a substance, numerically equal to the molecular weight of the substance, also called gram-molecular weight. pH. Measurement of the concentration of the hydrogen ion (H+) given in moles per litre (M) in a solution. The pH concept was proposed by S\u00f8rensen and Lindstr\u00f8m-\nLang in 1909 to facilitate expressing very low ion concentrations. It is defi  ned by the following equation:pH = \u2013log [H\n+]      or      [H+] = 10-pH \nIt measures the acidity of a solution. Example, in water the concentration of [H+] is 1.0 x 10-7 M resulting in pH = 7. This allows the range of concentrations from \n1 to 10-14 M, to be expressed from zero (0) to 14. There are diverse systems for measuring the acidity of a solution. An acidic substance  dissolved in water is capable \nof producing H+ ions. A basic substance dissolved in water is capable of producing [OH\u2013] (hydroxides) ions. An acid substance has a greater quantity of ions [H+] than pure water; a basic substance shows greater quantities of ions [OH\u2013] than pure water. The concentrations \nof substances are expressed in moles per litre. In pure water, the ion concentration [H+] and [OH\u2013] is 1.0 x 10\u20137 M, it is thus considered a neutral substance. In reality, it is a weak electrolyte that is dissociated \nfollowing the following equation:H\n2O  '  [H+][OH\u2013] \nIn all aqueous solutions there is a balance expressed as:   \n[H+][OH\u2013] = K \n     H2O\nIf the solution is diluted, the concentration of the non-dissociated water can be considered constant:\n[H+][OH\u2013] = [H2O]K = Ka\nThe new constant Ka is called a constant of dissociation or ionic product of water and its value is 1.0x10\u201314 at 25 \u00b0C. [H+][OH\u2013] = 1.0 x 10-14\nX x X = 1.0 x 10-14\nX2 = 1.0 x 10-14\nX = 1.0 x 10-7\nIn pure water the concentrations of H+ and OH\u2013 are 1.0 x 10\u20137 M, a very low concentration, given that the molar concentration of water is 55.4 mol\/litre.

OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThe biological safety cabinet is a chamber generally constructed of steel. It has a front glass window of adjustable \nheight, a ventilation system with an electrical motor, a ventilator and a set of ducts which while functioning, generate a negative pressure condition inside the cabinet. This forces the air to fl  ow from inside the cabinet through \nthe front opening to generate a curtain of air protecting the operator. Internally, the air is conducted through a series of grids and ducts to be finally treated in HEPA\n1  \nfi lters. Depending on the design of the cabinet, the air is \nrecycled inside the laboratory or extracted and renewed in diverse proportions. The air fl  ow, which in Class II cabinets \nmoves from the fi  lter towards the work surface, is laminar. A \nsummary of the existing type of cabinets and their principal characteristics is presented next. 1 HEPA: High Effi   ciency Particulate Air.

The above table complements the previous. It provides guidance in determining the standard weights to use in the calibration of a balance according to its capacity. ROUTINE MAINTENANCE\nThe balance is characterized as an instrument of high precision. For this reason, the operator is only responsible \nfor minimal maintenance limited to the following:\nDaily Activities\n1. Clean the weighing plate so that it is kept free of dust. Cleaning is done b y using a piece of clean cloth which \nmay be dampened with distilled water. If there is a stain, a mild detergent can be applied. Also a paintbrush with soft bristles can be used to remove particles or dust deposited on the weight plate. 2. Clean the weighing chamber, externally and internally. Verify that the glass is free from dust. 3. Verify that the adjustment mechanisms on the front \ndoor of the weighing chamber works adequately.4. Always use a clean, pre-weighed container for weighing \n(glass container or weighing paper if possible). Note that plastic can become electromagnetically charged and is not recommended for weighing powdered or granulated chemicals. 5.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>A perfectly levelled table\/counter. A platform of high \ninertia, isolated from the structures located in its vicinity is ideal to reduce the eff  ect of vibrations from certain \nequipment such as centrifuges and refrigerators. There must be a large enough area for installing the balance and any auxiliary equipment needed during the weighing processes. Likewise, the space required for cables such as the interconnection, electrical current cables and the information system connection to the printer must be anticipated. 3. Avoid installing equipment which produces elevated \nmagnetic fi  elds or vibrations like centrifuges, electrical \nmotors, compressors and generators in its vicinity. 4. Avoid locating it directly under the air-conditioning \nsystem (air currents) and sunlight. 5. An electrical outlet which complies with the current \nelectrical standards in the country or the laboratory. It must be in good condition and equipped with a ground pole and switches.Electronic balance operation\nThe operation of a modern electronic balance is clearly detailed in its operat or\u2019s manual from the manufacturer. In \ngeneral, it must conform to the following procedure:1. Allow the balance to equilibrate with the environment \nwhere it is installed. 2. Allow the balance to warm-up before initiating activities. Normally it is suffi   cient to have it connected to the \nelectrical feed system. Some manufacturers suggest at least 20 minutes from the moment it is energized until use. Analytical balances Class 1 require at least 2 hours for warming before initiating use. Verify that the balance is calibrated. Electronic \nbalances generally have a factory-made calibration stored in memory which can be used if it does not have calibration masses. If calibration is required, use calibrated masses as indicated by the manufacturer. The calibrated masses must conform or exceed the ASTM tolerances. For general information, the following table shows the accepted tolerance for the ASTM Class 1\n1 \nmasses. 3.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>(*)\n1.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Air which enters the cabinet through the front or work opening and replaces the air extracted from the cabinet.

Use titanium rotors if working with saline solutions \nfrequently. 8. Protect the rotors\u2019 coating in order to avoid the metal \nbase from deteriorating. Do not use alkaline detergents or cleaning solutions which can remove the protective fi lm. The rotors generally made of aluminium [Al] are \ncovered by a fi  lm of anodized aluminium which protects \ntheir metal structure. 9. Use plastic brushes when cleaning the rotor. Metal \nbrushes scratch the protective coating and generate sources for future corrosion. Corrosion is accelerated in operation conditions and shortens the rotor\u2019s operational life. 10. If there are spills of corrosive substances, wash the rotor \nimmediately. 11. Air dry the rotor once cleaned and washed with water.12. Store vertical tube rotors and almost vertical tube rotors \nwith the larger side facing downwards and without their covers. 13. Store rotors in a dry area. Avoid leaving them in the \ncentrifuge. 14. Store swinging buckets rotors without the compartments\u2019 \ncovers. 15.

Av oid using rotors whose operational lives have \nended. 18. Use a shield if working with radioactive material. 19. Load or unload rotors inside a biological safety cabinet \nif working with materials classifi  ed as Biosafety level II \nor higher. 20. Never try to open the cover of a centrifuge while it is \nfunctioning and never try to stop the rotor by hand. Tubes \nTube care includes aspects such as fi  lling of the tubes, adequat e temperature selection, centrifugation speed \nlimitations, washing and sterilization. The principle recommendations are the following:1. Wash tubes, adaptors and other accessories by hand \nusing a 1:10 mild detergent solution in water and a soft textured brush (not metallic). Avoid using automatic dishwashers. 2. Avoid using alcohol and acetone since such liquids aff  ect \nthe structure of the tubes. Manufacturers recommend the solvent to be used with each type of centrifugation tube material. 3. Avoid drying tubes in a drying oven. Dry always with a \nstream of hot air.4. Verify if the tubes are reusable or not. If they are \ndisposable, use them only once. 5. For sterilizing, it is necessary to verify the material from \nwhich the tube is made, as not all can stand sterilization by heat. Glass tubes are normally sterilized with vapour at 121 \u00b0C for 30 minutes. 6. Store tubes and bottles in a dark, fresh, dry place, \nfar from chemical vapours or ultraviolet radiation sources. 7. Verify maximum fi  lling levels and the sealing of thin \nwall tubes in order to avoid collapse inside the rotor by the action of the centrifugal force. Comply with manufacturers recommendations. Preventive maintenance\nWarning:  Nev er carry out a technical intervention in a \ncentrifuge if it has not been previously decontaminated. The most important maintenance routines performed on a \ncentrifuge are the following:Frequency: Monthly1. Verify that the centrifuge external components are free \nof dust and stains. Avoid aff  ecting the rotor with spills. Clean the rotor compartment using a mild detergent. 2. Test that the rotors\u2019 connecting and adjustment \nmechanisms are in good condition. Keep the points lubricated as the manufacturer recommends. 3. Verify the locking \/safety mechanism of the centrifuge\u2019s \ncover.

The water distiller, also called distillation unit or water still, used in the laboratory, purifi  es running water by means of controlled \nvaporization and cooling processes. Upon applying thermal energy to water in a liquid phase by a warming process, it is changed into vapour. This allows the water molecules to separate from the molecules of other substances mixed or diluted. The water vapour is collected and passed through a condenser, where it is cooled and returned to the liquid phase. Then, the condensed water is collected into a diff  erent storage tank. Distilled water shows pure \ncharacteristics compared to running water; it is practically free of contaminating substances.PURPOSE OF THE WATER DISTILLER\nThe water distiller facilitates obtaining very pure water from potable wat er normally provided by the aqueduct services \nin urban centres. Distilled water is characterized by a lack of solids in suspension. It is used in multiple applications in centres which provide health services, especially in laboratory units, in washing, sterilization and dietetics. The more specialized the procedures are in the laboratory, the greater will be the level of purity required. For example: the preparation of reagents or biological material requires water of the highest quality. Distillation is one of the fundamental processes to achieve this (although it may not be the only one required). Water used in laboratories must be free of pyrogens, with a concentration of total solids no greater than 1 ppm, a pH value between 5.4 and 7.2 and an electrical resistance of at least 3 x 10\n5 ohm\/cm at 25 \u00b0C1. 1 Warming cabinets, sterilizers, and associated equipment , Division 11\u2013 \nEquipment, USACE\/NAVFAC\/ AFCESA, UFGS-11710, July 2003.

When atmospheric conditions are suitable, these cool and condense the water which returns to the surface of the Earth in the form of rain. Functioning of the water distiller\nThe water distiller reproduces the natural phenomenon described abo ve. The configuration and design vary \ndepending on the volume of water required. The following is a general explanation of the components of a distiller and a description of how these function. 1. Vapour generator. Also known as the boiling tank, \nthis component is the container where the water to be distilled is stored. In general, it has a hydraulic connection which allows the water evaporated and distilled to be replenished. It is generally made of glass in small distillers or of stainless steel with copper, tin or titanium coverings in large capacity machines. It can have level, fl  ow and water quality feed controls, which \nprotect the distiller in case some irregularity in the water supply occurs. As a source of energy, it uses the water vapour coming from a boiler or vapour generator, or the thermal energy from electrical immersion resistors through direct conduction. These cause the water temperature to rise until, in normal conditions (atmospheric pressure equal to an atmosphere and gravity acceleration equal to 9.80665 m\/s\n2) water in the \nliquid phase is transformed into vapour at 100 \u00b0C. 2.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Motor\/ventilator system functioning test. Determines \nif the system provides the necessary static pressure. 14. Electric system test. Determines if there are potential \nrisks of electrical discharges. Measures the escaping currents, the polarity, the functioning of the ground defect protection system and the ground circuit resistance. FUNCTIONAL EVALUATION (ALTERNATIVE)\nIn case there are biological safety cabinets in the laboratory, but no authoriz ed certification services available, the \npersonnel responsible for maintenance has the option of conducting annual revision procedures based on Standard NSF 49. Duly documented, it should identify with low levels of uncertainty if the cabinet is in good condition and its operation normal\n2. The following are outlines of how these \nactivities must be done.1. Installation evaluation. Verify that the cabinet \ninstallation conditions are in accordance with the recommendations from the manufacturer. 1 (*) These require specialized decontamination beforehand. 2 The functional evaluation is essentially based on the availability \n(institutional or zonal) of properly trained and experienced technicians and engineers.CHAPTER 6  BIOLOGICAL SAFETY CABINET\n422. Operational evaluation. Test to see if the cabinet is \nworking in accordance with its manufacturing and design characteristics. 3. Performance evaluation. Verify the cabinet\u2019s capacity to \nprovide an adequate work space in normal and critical working conditions.In the following table are featured the parameters to be \ntaken into account in the functional evaluation. These are generally included in inspection forms\n1 designed for this \npurpose.

Only load and install the materials and equipment \nrequired for the test or manipulation. Distinguish between the clean areas and dirty areas. Place the material in such a way that the clean materials do not mix or cross used or dirty materials or impede the circulation of the internal air through the front and back grids. Place a biosafety bag for disposing waste materials, a container with disinfectant for the pipettes and a container for storing sharps. Avoid locating very large objects near one another. Upon fi  nalizing the placing of the materials, the fl  ow of air must be allowed \nto sweep through the cabinet for approximately 3 to 5 minutes in order to eliminate any particle produced or freed during the loading of materials and equipment. 5.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>7. Use titanium rotors if working with saline solutions \nfrequently. 8. Protect the rotors\u2019 coating in order to avoid the metal \nbase from deteriorating. Do not use alkaline detergents or cleaning solutions which can remove the protective fi lm. The rotors generally made of aluminium [Al] are \ncovered by a fi  lm of anodized aluminium which protects \ntheir metal structure. 9. Use plastic brushes when cleaning the rotor. Metal \nbrushes scratch the protective coating and generate sources for future corrosion. Corrosion is accelerated in operation conditions and shortens the rotor\u2019s operational life. 10. If there are spills of corrosive substances, wash the rotor \nimmediately. 11. Air dry the rotor once cleaned and washed with water.12. Store vertical tube rotors and almost vertical tube rotors \nwith the larger side facing downwards and without their covers. 13. Store rotors in a dry area. Avoid leaving them in the \ncentrifuge. 14. Store swinging buckets rotors without the compartments\u2019 \ncovers. 15. Lubricate spiral and O-rings, according to the \nmanufacturer\u2019s recommendation. 16. Observe re commendations related to guaranteed times \nand operational life of each type of rotor. 17. Av oid using rotors whose operational lives have \nended. 18. Use a shield if working with radioactive material. 19. Load or unload rotors inside a biological safety cabinet \nif working with materials classifi  ed as Biosafety level II \nor higher. 20. Never try to open the cover of a centrifuge while it is \nfunctioning and never try to stop the rotor by hand. Tubes \nTube care includes aspects such as fi  lling of the tubes, adequat e temperature selection, centrifugation speed \nlimitations, washing and sterilization. The principle recommendations are the following:1. Wash tubes, adaptors and other accessories by hand \nusing a 1:10 mild detergent solution in water and a soft textured brush (not metallic). Avoid using automatic dishwashers. 2. Avoid using alcohol and acetone since such liquids aff  ect \nthe structure of the tubes. Manufacturers recommend the solvent to be used with each type of centrifugation tube material. 3. Avoid drying tubes in a drying oven. Dry always with a \nstream of hot air.4. Verify if the tubes are reusable or not. If they are \ndisposable, use them only once. 5. For sterilizing, it is necessary to verify the material from \nwhich the tube is made, as not all can stand sterilization by heat. Glass tubes are normally sterilized with vapour at 121 \u00b0C for 30 minutes. 6. Store tubes and bottles in a dark, fresh, dry place, \nfar from chemical vapours or ultraviolet radiation sources. 7. Verify maximum fi  lling levels and the sealing of thin \nwall tubes in order to avoid collapse inside the rotor by the action of the centrifugal force. Comply with manufacturers recommendations. Preventive maintenance\nWarning:  Nev er carry out a technical intervention in a \ncentrifuge if it has not been previously decontaminated. The most important maintenance routines performed on a \ncentrifuge are the following:Frequency: Monthly1. Verify that the centrifuge external components are free \nof dust and stains. Avoid aff  ecting the rotor with spills. Clean the rotor compartment using a mild detergent. 2. Test that the rotors\u2019 connecting and adjustment \nmechanisms are in good condition. Keep the points lubricated as the manufacturer recommends. 3. Verify the locking \/safety mechanism of the centrifuge\u2019s \ncover. This is fundamental in guaranteeing operators\u2019 safety as this mechanism keeps the cover of the centrifuge closed while the rotor is turning. 4.<\/DOCUMENT>\n4.

OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThe biological safety cabinet is a chamber generally constructed of steel. It has a front glass window of adjustable \nheight, a ventilation system with an electrical motor, a ventilator and a set of ducts which while functioning, generate a negative pressure condition inside the cabinet. This forces the air to fl  ow from inside the cabinet through \nthe front opening to generate a curtain of air protecting the operator. Internally, the air is conducted through a series of grids and ducts to be finally treated in HEPA\n1  \nfi lters. Depending on the design of the cabinet, the air is \nrecycled inside the laboratory or extracted and renewed in diverse proportions.

The microplate washer performs the washing of the ELISA plate\u2019s wells during the diff  erent stages of the technique. PHOTOGRAPH OF MICROPLATE WASHER \nPURPOSE OF THE MICROPLATE WASHER \nThe microplate washer has been designed to supply cleaning \nbuff ers required for the ELISA technique in a controlled \nmanner. In the same fashion, the equipment removes from each well, substances in excess from the reaction. Depending on the test performed, the washer can intervene from one to four times, supplying the washing buff  er, agitating and \nremoving the unbound reagents\n1 until the programmed \ntimes and cycles are completed. The washer has of two reservoirs; one for the washing buff  er, the other for the waste \ngenerated during the washing process.OPERATION PRINCIPLES \nThe microplate washer has been designed to perform washing operations in the ELISA t echnique. The equipment \npossesses at least, the following subsystems which vary depending on the manufacturer\u2019s design. \u2022\u2022 Control subsystem. Generally , the washer is controlled \nby microprocessors allowing programming and controlling steps to be performed by the washer such as: number of washing cycles\n2 (1\u20135); expected times; \nsupplying and extracting pressures; plate format (96\u2013384 wells); suction function adjustment according to the type of well\n3 (fl at bottom, V bottom or rounded \nbottom or strips used); volumes distributed or aspirated; the soaking and agitation cycles, etc. \u2022\u2022 Supply subsystem. In general, this comprises a reservoir \nfor the washing solution; one or several pumps; usually a positive displacement type syringe and a dispenser head that supplies the washing solution to the diff  erent \nwells by means of needles. The head usually comes with eight pairs of needles for washing and aspirating simultaneously the wells of the same row (the supply and extraction sub-systems converge on the head). There are models with twelve pairs of needles and others that conduct the washing process simultaneously in all the wells. Some washers off  er the possibility of working \nwith diff  erent types of washing solutions, performing \nthe solution changes according to the program entered by the operator. 1 See a brief explication of the ELISA technique in Chapter 1, Microplate \nReader . 2 The exact number of washing operations required depends on the assay \nused.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Reinstall the cover.12.

A platform of high \ninertia, isolated from the structures located in its vicinity is ideal to reduce the eff  ect of vibrations from certain \nequipment such as centrifuges and refrigerators. There must be a large enough area for installing the balance and any auxiliary equipment needed during the weighing processes. Likewise, the space required for cables such as the interconnection, electrical current cables and the information system connection to the printer must be anticipated. 3. Avoid installing equipment which produces elevated \nmagnetic fi  elds or vibrations like centrifuges, electrical \nmotors, compressors and generators in its vicinity. 4. Avoid locating it directly under the air-conditioning \nsystem (air currents) and sunlight. 5. An electrical outlet which complies with the current \nelectrical standards in the country or the laboratory. It must be in good condition and equipped with a ground pole and switches.Electronic balance operation\nThe operation of a modern electronic balance is clearly detailed in its operat or\u2019s manual from the manufacturer. In \ngeneral, it must conform to the following procedure:1. Allow the balance to equilibrate with the environment \nwhere it is installed. 2. Allow the balance to warm-up before initiating activities. Normally it is suffi   cient to have it connected to the \nelectrical feed system. Some manufacturers suggest at least 20 minutes from the moment it is energized until use. Analytical balances Class 1 require at least 2 hours for warming before initiating use. Verify that the balance is calibrated. Electronic \nbalances generally have a factory-made calibration stored in memory which can be used if it does not have calibration masses. If calibration is required, use calibrated masses as indicated by the manufacturer. The calibrated masses must conform or exceed the ASTM tolerances. For general information, the following table shows the accepted tolerance for the ASTM Class 1\n1 \nmasses. 3.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>3. Replacing ventilators. (*) 4. Replacing the HEPA fi  lter (*).

PURPOSE OF THE EQUIPMENT\nThe pH meter is commonly used in any fi  eld of science \nrelated to aqueous solutions. It is used in areas such as agriculture, water treatment and purifi  cation, in industrial \nprocesses such as petrochemicals, paper manufacture, foods, pharmaceuticals, research and development, metal mechanics, etc. In the health laboratory, its applications are related to the control of culture mediums and to the measurement of the alkalinity or acidity of broths and buff ers. In specialized laboratories, diagnostic equipment \nmicroelectrodes are used to measure the pH of liquid blood components. The plasma pH allows the patient\u2019s health to be evaluated. It normally measures between 7.35 and 7.45. This value relates to the patient\u2019s metabolism in which a multitude of reactions occurs where acids and bases are normally kept in balance. Acids constantly liberate hydrogen ions [H\n+] and the organism neutralizes or balances \nacidity by liberating bicarbonate ions [HCO3\u2013]. The acid-base \nratio in the organism is maintained by the kidneys, (organs in which any excesses present are eliminated).

A process through which a fl  uid in liquid phase is heated until converted into vapour and then cooled and condensed back into liquid phase. The \ndistillation process is used for separating mixed substances, taking advantage of their diff  erence in volatility. To obtain ver y pure substances, consecutive distillation \ncycles are performed with the aim of progressively eliminating other substances present in the mix. Hardness (of water). A chemical characteristic of water determined by the carbonate, bicarbonate, chlorine, sulphate and occasionally calcium nitra te and \nmagnesium content. The resulting resistance is undesirable in some processes. There are two types of resistors in water. \u2022 Temporary hardness. This is determined by the magnesium and calcium carbonate and bicarbonate content. It may be eliminated by boiling the water a nd \nsubsequently fi  ltering out the precipitate. It is also known as carbonate resistance. \u2022 Permanent hardness. This is determined by all the calcium and magnesium salts, except the carbonates and bicarbonates. It cannot be eliminated by the \nboiling of water and it is also known as non-bicarbonate resistance. Interpretation of resistance:Resistance as CaCO\n3 interpretation\n 0\u201375 soft water 75\u2013150 water with little resistance 150\u2013300 resistant water > 300 water with great resistanceIn potable water, the maximum limit allowed is 300 mg \/l.In water for heaters, the limit is 0 mg \/ l. \u2022 Calcium resistance or hardness (RCa\n++). Quantity of calcium present in water. \u2022 Magnesium resistance or hardness (RMg++). Quantity of magnesium present in water. \u2022 Total resistance or general hardness [TH]. Quantity in calcium [Ca] solution and magnesium [Mg] as cations, without taking into account the nature of the \nanions present in the water. It is expressed as ppm (parts per million) of calcium carbonate (CaCo3). Incrustation (scale). A name given to solids in suspension deposited in layers on the surface of water storage containers. Solution. A homogenous mix of two or more substances characterized by the absence of chemical reactions between the components of the li quid mixture. The \nliquid component which generally appears in greater proportion is called the solvent  and that found in a lesser quantity in solution, the solute .MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n59Chapter 9\nDilutor\nThe dilutor is used for diluting substances. Dilute comes \nfrom the Latin word diluere  and means to add liquid to a \nsolution. Solutions are defi  ned as homogeneous mixtures \nof two or more components which may be gaseous, liquid or solid. To dilute is to reduce the strength of a fl uid in a solvent, generally water. The dilutor facilitates \nthe preparation of liquid mixtures, until these achieve a proportion (concentration) suitable for use in different diagnostic processes. The identification of this type of equipment is generalized using the word dilutor. DIAGRAM OF A DILUTORPURPOSE OF THE DILUTOR\nThe purpose of the dilutor is to prepare mixtures of \nsubstanc es to achieve determined concentrations and \nvolumes as done with a pipette, but with the advantage of an automated or programmed process. Dilutors vary in size and complexity.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Angular speed. The turning rate of a body measured in radians per second. It is calculated using the following formula:\nWhere: \nrpm = revolutions per minute\u03c0 = constant with a value of 3.1416\nBrush. A device that transmits electrical energy between the external electrical connection (cables in a static state) and the intern al components (in rotation) of a \nmotor. In general, brushes are manufactured in very soft textured graphite and, in motors, must be changed regularly (every six  months). Centrifugal force. Apparent force equal and opposite to the centripetal force, driving a rotating body away from the centre of rotation and cause d by the inertia of \nthe body. It is one of the components of the inertia vector, which equals the set of forces acting on a body. Its magnitude is always [m x a\nn] and its direction radial, \nmoving away from the centre. Density. A body\u2019s mass by volume unit, generally expressed in gram per cm3. Isopycnic separation. A method for separating particles based on the density of the particle\u2019s fl  otation. It is known as sedimentation in balance. T he speed of a \nparticle due to diff  erences in density is given in the formula:\nWhere: \nv = speed of sedimentation\nd = diameter of the particle \n\u03c1p = density of the particle \n\u03c1c = density of the solution\n \u00b5 = viscosity of the liquid medium g = gravitational force \nRadian.

Its purpose is to give a better \nunderstanding of the technical requirements regarding installation, use and maintenance of various types of equipment which play an important role in performing diagnostic testing. The manual also aims to provide support to personnel responsible for technical management, implementation of quality management and maintenance. Due to the diversity of origins, brands and models, this manual off  ers general recommendations. Equipment-specifi  c details \nare explained in depth in the maintenance and installation user manuals from manufacturers. These should be requested and ordered through the procurement processes of the individual agencies and professionals responsible for the acquisition of technology, or directly from the manufacturer. This manual was originally developed by the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) to support improved quality \nprogrammes which PAHO promotes in regional laboratories. The English version was produced by WHO to further expand support for quality programmes in other regions. The revised edition now includes 20 equipment groups selected to cover those most commonly used in low to medium technical complexity laboratories across the world. Given the diff  erences in \ntechnical complexity, brands and existing models, each chapter has been developed with basic equipment in mind, including new technology where relevant. The following information is included in each chapter: \n\u2022\u2022 Groups of equipment, organized by their generic names. Alternative names have also been included. \u2022\u2022 Photographs or diagrams, or a combination of both t o identify the type of equipment under consideration. \u2022\u2022 A brief explanation on the main uses or applications of the equipment in the laboratory. \u2022\u2022 A basic description of the principles by which the equipment operates with explanations of principles or physical and\/or \nchemical la ws which the interested reader can \u2013 or should study in depth. \u2022\u2022 Installation requirements with emphasis on the electrical aspects and the r equirements for safe installation and operation, \nincluding worldwide electrical standards. \u2022\u2022 Basic routine maintenance, classifi  ed according to the required frequency (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually \nor sporadically).

Sterilization of the distilled water storage tank1 The minerals deposited on the cover of the immersion resistors are \nparticularly poor heat conductors in that they impede an effi   cient transfer \nof heat between the immersion resistance and the water in the distillation process. This makes the temperature of the resistance rise above that it would reach in normal operating conditions, deteriorating its condition and integrity.. CHAPTER 8  WATER DISTILLER\n56Frequency: Occasionally\nBefore operating a new water distiller, it is recommended to insure that the distilled water storage tank is sterile and clean. To carry out the sterilization, use a chemical process with domestic bleach (chlorine based), for example.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>The standards must be consulted for details. The certifi  cation process comprises \nthe following tests: 1. Air tightness test. This is done on the exterior surfaces. Determine if joints, seals, penetration and solderings are free from leaks. 2. HEPA \ufb01  lter leak tests. Determines the integrity of the \nsupply and extraction of HEPA fi  lters, their location and \nmounted frames. 3.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>4.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>5.

Use the dilutor with less intensity.CHAPTER 9  DILUTOR\n64BASIC DEFINITIONS\nCavitations. A phenomenon in fl  uids when a vacuum is created upon emptying a vessel. The pressure decreases until it reaches the vapour pre ssure of the fl  uid. This produces diverse phenomena such as vaporization of gases dissolved in the liquid or, in the case of water, the formation o f vapour bubbles collapsing after an \ninfi  nitesimal time lapse, perforating the surfaces of conducts in the immediate vicinity. This occurs in dilutors when using la rge capacity syringes with elevated \npropulsion speed. Concentration. A quantity measurement of a chemical substance present in a solution. The concept is expressed as the quantity of a substance dissolved into a \nsolvent. Concentration is expressed in diverse forms; the most common are: molarity [M], molality [m], normality [N], percentag e rate of solute. Dilution. To reduce the concentration of a solution by adding other fl  uids. The fl  uid added is known as the diluent . Adding the molecules of a liquid substance with \nthe molecules of another liquid substance. In order to determine the volume V1 of liquid needed to obtain V2 volume at a concen tration C2 from a stock solution of \nconcentration C1, the following equation is used:  \nDispenser. A device used for distributing liquids.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>2. A stable work table located away from equipment \nthat generates vibrations, (centrifuges, and agitators).

A process through which a fl  uid in liquid phase is heated until converted into vapour and then cooled and condensed back into liquid phase. The \ndistillation process is used for separating mixed substances, taking advantage of their diff  erence in volatility. To obtain ver y pure substances, consecutive distillation \ncycles are performed with the aim of progressively eliminating other substances present in the mix. Hardness (of water). A chemical characteristic of water determined by the carbonate, bicarbonate, chlorine, sulphate and occasionally calcium nitra te and \nmagnesium content. The resulting resistance is undesirable in some processes. There are two types of resistors in water. \u2022 Temporary hardness. This is determined by the magnesium and calcium carbonate and bicarbonate content. It may be eliminated by boiling the water a nd \nsubsequently fi  ltering out the precipitate. It is also known as carbonate resistance. \u2022 Permanent hardness. This is determined by all the calcium and magnesium salts, except the carbonates and bicarbonates. It cannot be eliminated by the \nboiling of water and it is also known as non-bicarbonate resistance. Interpretation of resistance:Resistance as CaCO\n3 interpretation\n 0\u201375 soft water 75\u2013150 water with little resistance 150\u2013300 resistant water > 300 water with great resistanceIn potable water, the maximum limit allowed is 300 mg \/l.In water for heaters, the limit is 0 mg \/ l. \u2022 Calcium resistance or hardness (RCa\n++).

Quantity in calcium [Ca] solution and magnesium [Mg] as cations, without taking into account the nature of the \nanions present in the water. It is expressed as ppm (parts per million) of calcium carbonate (CaCo3). Incrustation (scale). A name given to solids in suspension deposited in layers on the surface of water storage containers. Solution. A homogenous mix of two or more substances characterized by the absence of chemical reactions between the components of the li quid mixture. The \nliquid component which generally appears in greater proportion is called the solvent  and that found in a lesser quantity in solution, the solute .MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n59Chapter 9\nDilutor\nThe dilutor is used for diluting substances. Dilute comes \nfrom the Latin word diluere  and means to add liquid to a \nsolution. Solutions are defi  ned as homogeneous mixtures \nof two or more components which may be gaseous, liquid or solid. To dilute is to reduce the strength of a fl uid in a solvent, generally water. The dilutor facilitates \nthe preparation of liquid mixtures, until these achieve a proportion (concentration) suitable for use in different diagnostic processes. The identification of this type of equipment is generalized using the word dilutor. DIAGRAM OF A DILUTORPURPOSE OF THE DILUTOR\nThe purpose of the dilutor is to prepare mixtures of \nsubstanc es to achieve determined concentrations and \nvolumes as done with a pipette, but with the advantage of an automated or programmed process. Dilutors vary in size and complexity.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>2. A measuring device known as \u201cload cell\u201d produces an \nexit signal corresponding to the load\u2019s force in the form of changes in the voltage or frequency. 3. A digital analogous electronic circuit shows the fi  nal \nresult of the weight digitally. Laboratory balances operate according to the principle \nof compensation of the electromagnetic force applicable to displacements or torques. The combination of their mechanical components and automatic reading systems provides weight measurements at defi  ned levels of accuracy \ndepending on the model. Principle. The mobile parts (weighing plate, support \ncolumn [a], bobbin, position and load indicator [G] -the object in the process of being weighed-) are maintained in equilibrium by a compensation force [F] equal to the weight. The compensation force is generated by an electrical current through a bobbin in the air gap of a cylindrical electromagnet. The force F is calculated with the equation [F = I x L x B] where: I = electrical intensity, L = total length of the wire of the coil and B = magnetic fl  ow intensity in the \nelectromagnet\u2019s air gap.With any change in the load (weight\/mass), the mobile \nmechanical system responds by moving vertically a fraction of distance. Detected by a photosensor [e], an electrical signal is sent to the servo-amplifi  er [f]. This changes the \nfl ow of electrical current passing through the bobbin of the \nmagnet [c] in such a manner that the mobile system returns to the balanced position upon adjusting of the magnetic fl ow in the electromagnet. Consequently, the weight of \nthe mass [G] can be measured indirectly at the start of the electrical current fl  ow, which passes through the circuit \nmeasuring the voltage [V] by means of a precision resistor [R], [V = I x R]. To date, many systems developed use the electronic system for carrying out very exact measurements of mass and weight. The following diagram explains how electronic balances function.

Compensation force principle  \nMAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n25The signal processing system\nThe signal processing system is composed of the circuit which \ntransf orms the electrical signal emitted by the transducer \ninto numerical data which can be read on a screen. The signal process comprises the following functions:1. Tare setting. This setting is used to adjust the reading \nvalue at zero with any load within the balance\u2019s capacity range. It is controlled by a button generally located on the front part of the balance. It is commonly used for taring the weighing container. 2. Repeatability setting control. During a reading, weighed \nvalues are averaged within a predefi  ned period of time. This function is very useful when weighing operations need to be carried out in unstable conditions, e.g. in the presence of air currents or vibrations. This control defi nes the time period allowed for a result to lie within \npreset limits for it to be considered stable. In addition, it can be adjusted to suit a particular application.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Verify that electronic cards are clean and well connected.2. Test operation controls needed for selection of the \ndiff erent parameters of the centrifuge: speed, time, \ntemperature, alarms selectors and analogous or digital instruments. 3.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>(abbreviation for molecule). A quantity of any substance whose mass expressed in grams is numerically equal to its atomic mass. Mole (unit). The amount of a substance that contains as many atoms, molecules, ions, or other elementary units as the number of atoms in 0. 012 kilogram of \ncarbon 12. It corresponds to the number 6.0225 \u00d7 1023, or Avogadro\u2019s number, also called gram molecule. The mass in grams of this amount of a substance, numerically equal to the molecular weight of the substance, also called gram-molecular weight. pH. Measurement of the concentration of the hydrogen ion (H+) given in moles per litre (M) in a solution. The pH concept was proposed by S\u00f8rensen and Lindstr\u00f8m-\nLang in 1909 to facilitate expressing very low ion concentrations. It is defi  ned by the following equation:pH = \u2013log [H\n+]      or      [H+] = 10-pH \nIt measures the acidity of a solution. Example, in water the concentration of [H+] is 1.0 x 10-7 M resulting in pH = 7. This allows the range of concentrations from \n1 to 10-14 M, to be expressed from zero (0) to 14. There are diverse systems for measuring the acidity of a solution. An acidic substance  dissolved in water is capable \nof producing H+ ions. A basic substance dissolved in water is capable of producing [OH\u2013] (hydroxides) ions. An acid substance has a greater quantity of ions [H+] than pure water; a basic substance shows greater quantities of ions [OH\u2013] than pure water. The concentrations \nof substances are expressed in moles per litre. In pure water, the ion concentration [H+] and [OH\u2013] is 1.0 x 10\u20137 M, it is thus considered a neutral substance. In reality, it is a weak electrolyte that is dissociated \nfollowing the following equation:H\n2O  '  [H+][OH\u2013] \nIn all aqueous solutions there is a balance expressed as:   \n[H+][OH\u2013] = K \n     H2O\nIf the solution is diluted, the concentration of the non-dissociated water can be considered constant:\n[H+][OH\u2013] = [H2O]K = Ka\nThe new constant Ka is called a constant of dissociation or ionic product of water and its value is 1.0x10\u201314 at 25 \u00b0C. [H+][OH\u2013] = 1.0 x 10-14\nX x X = 1.0 x 10-14\nX2 = 1.0 x 10-14\nX = 1.0 x 10-7\nIn pure water the concentrations of H+ and OH\u2013 are 1.0 x 10\u20137 M, a very low concentration, given that the molar concentration of water is 55.4 mol\/litre.

A measuring device known as \u201cload cell\u201d produces an \nexit signal corresponding to the load\u2019s force in the form of changes in the voltage or frequency. 3. A digital analogous electronic circuit shows the fi  nal \nresult of the weight digitally. Laboratory balances operate according to the principle \nof compensation of the electromagnetic force applicable to displacements or torques. The combination of their mechanical components and automatic reading systems provides weight measurements at defi  ned levels of accuracy \ndepending on the model. Principle. The mobile parts (weighing plate, support \ncolumn [a], bobbin, position and load indicator [G] -the object in the process of being weighed-) are maintained in equilibrium by a compensation force [F] equal to the weight. The compensation force is generated by an electrical current through a bobbin in the air gap of a cylindrical electromagnet. The force F is calculated with the equation [F = I x L x B] where: I = electrical intensity, L = total length of the wire of the coil and B = magnetic fl  ow intensity in the \nelectromagnet\u2019s air gap.With any change in the load (weight\/mass), the mobile \nmechanical system responds by moving vertically a fraction of distance. Detected by a photosensor [e], an electrical signal is sent to the servo-amplifi  er [f]. This changes the \nfl ow of electrical current passing through the bobbin of the \nmagnet [c] in such a manner that the mobile system returns to the balanced position upon adjusting of the magnetic fl ow in the electromagnet. Consequently, the weight of \nthe mass [G] can be measured indirectly at the start of the electrical current fl  ow, which passes through the circuit \nmeasuring the voltage [V] by means of a precision resistor [R], [V = I x R]. To date, many systems developed use the electronic system for carrying out very exact measurements of mass and weight. The following diagram explains how electronic balances function.

Compensation force principle  \nMAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n25The signal processing system\nThe signal processing system is composed of the circuit which \ntransf orms the electrical signal emitted by the transducer \ninto numerical data which can be read on a screen. The signal process comprises the following functions:1. Tare setting. This setting is used to adjust the reading \nvalue at zero with any load within the balance\u2019s capacity range. It is controlled by a button generally located on the front part of the balance. It is commonly used for taring the weighing container. 2. Repeatability setting control. During a reading, weighed \nvalues are averaged within a predefi  ned period of time. This function is very useful when weighing operations need to be carried out in unstable conditions, e.g. in the presence of air currents or vibrations. This control defi nes the time period allowed for a result to lie within \npreset limits for it to be considered stable. In addition, it can be adjusted to suit a particular application.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>3. Replacing ventilators. (*) 4. Replacing the HEPA fi  lter (*).

This equipment, provided \nit is carefully used and calibrated, measures the acidity of an aqueous solution. pH meters are sometimes called pH analysers, pH monitors or potentiometers. PURPOSE OF THE EQUIPMENT\nThe pH meter is commonly used in any fi  eld of science \nrelated to aqueous solutions. It is used in areas such as agriculture, water treatment and purifi  cation, in industrial \nprocesses such as petrochemicals, paper manufacture, foods, pharmaceuticals, research and development, metal mechanics, etc. In the health laboratory, its applications are related to the control of culture mediums and to the measurement of the alkalinity or acidity of broths and buff ers. In specialized laboratories, diagnostic equipment \nmicroelectrodes are used to measure the pH of liquid blood components. The plasma pH allows the patient\u2019s health to be evaluated. It normally measures between 7.35 and 7.45. This value relates to the patient\u2019s metabolism in which a multitude of reactions occurs where acids and bases are normally kept in balance. Acids constantly liberate hydrogen ions [H\n+] and the organism neutralizes or balances \nacidity by liberating bicarbonate ions [HCO3\u2013]. The acid-base \nratio in the organism is maintained by the kidneys, (organs in which any excesses present are eliminated). The plasma pH is one of the characteristics that vary with factors such as age or state of health of the patient. Table 1 shows typical pH values of some bodily fl  uids.PHOTOGRAPH AND COMPONENTS OF THE \npH METER\nOPERA TION PRINCIPLES\nThe pH meter measures the concentration of hydrogen ions \n[H+] using an ion-sensitive electrode.

The water distiller, also called distillation unit or water still, used in the laboratory, purifi  es running water by means of controlled \nvaporization and cooling processes. Upon applying thermal energy to water in a liquid phase by a warming process, it is changed into vapour. This allows the water molecules to separate from the molecules of other substances mixed or diluted. The water vapour is collected and passed through a condenser, where it is cooled and returned to the liquid phase. Then, the condensed water is collected into a diff  erent storage tank. Distilled water shows pure \ncharacteristics compared to running water; it is practically free of contaminating substances.PURPOSE OF THE WATER DISTILLER\nThe water distiller facilitates obtaining very pure water from potable wat er normally provided by the aqueduct services \nin urban centres. Distilled water is characterized by a lack of solids in suspension. It is used in multiple applications in centres which provide health services, especially in laboratory units, in washing, sterilization and dietetics. The more specialized the procedures are in the laboratory, the greater will be the level of purity required. For example: the preparation of reagents or biological material requires water of the highest quality. Distillation is one of the fundamental processes to achieve this (although it may not be the only one required). Water used in laboratories must be free of pyrogens, with a concentration of total solids no greater than 1 ppm, a pH value between 5.4 and 7.2 and an electrical resistance of at least 3 x 10\n5 ohm\/cm at 25 \u00b0C1. 1 Warming cabinets, sterilizers, and associated equipment , Division 11\u2013 \nEquipment, USACE\/NAVFAC\/ AFCESA, UFGS-11710, July 2003.

This information, along with good use and care, helps to maintain laboratory equipment in optimal condition.MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n1The microplate reader also known as \u201cPhotometric \nmicro-plate reader or ELISA reader\u201d is a specialized spectrophotometer designed to read results of the ELISA test, a technique used to determine the presence of antibodies or specifi  c antigens in samples. The technique \nis based on the detection of an antigen or antibodies captured on a solid surface using direct or secondary, labelled antibodies, producing a reaction whose product can be read by the spectrophotometer. The word ELISA is the acronym for \u201cEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay\u201d . This chapter covers the use of microplate readers for ELISA testing. For additional information on the instrument principles of operation and maintenance, consult Chapter 11 discussing the spectrophotometer. PHOTOGRAPH OF MICROPLATE READER\nPURPOSE OF THE MICROPLATE READER\nThe microplate reader is used for reading the results of ELISA \ntests. This technique has a direct application in immunology and serology. Among other applications it confi  rms the \npresence of antibodies or antigens of an infectious agent in an organism, antibodies from a vaccine or auto-antibodies, for example in rheumatoid arthritis.OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThe microplate reader is a specialized spectrophotometer. Unlike the c onventional spectrophotometer which facilitates \nreadings on a wide range of wavelengths, the microplate reader has filters or diffraction gratings that limit the wavelength range to that used in ELISA, generally between 400 to 750 nm (nanometres). Some readers operate in the ultraviolet range and carry out analyses between 340 to 700 nm. The optical system exploited by many manufacturers uses optic fi  bres to supply light to the microplate wells \ncontaining the samples. The light beam, passing through the sample has a diameter ranging between 1 to 3 mm. A detection system detects the light coming from the sample, amplifi  es the signal and determines the sample\u2019s \nabsorbance. A reading system converts it into data allowing the test result interpretation. Some microplate readers use double beam light systems. Test samples are located in specially designed plates with \na specifi  c number of wells where the procedure or test is \ncarried out. Plates of 8 columns by 12 rows with a total of 96 wells are common. There are also plates with a greater number of wells. For specialized applications, the current trend is to increase the number of wells (384-well plates) to reduce the amount of reagents and samples used and a greater throughput. The location of the optical sensors of the microplate reader varies depending on the manufacturers: these can be located above the sample plate, or directly underneath the plate\u2019s wells. Nowadays microplate readers have controls regulated by \nmicroprocessors; connection interfaces to information systems; quality and process control programs, which by means of a computer, allow complete test automation.Chapter 1\nMicroplate Reader\nGMDN Code 37036\nECRI Code 16-979\nDenomination Photometric micro-plate reader\nPhoto courtesy of BioRad Laboratories CHAPTER 1  MICROPLATE READER\n2Equipment required for ELISA testing\nIn order to perform the ELISA technique, the following \nequipment is r equired:  \n1.

The dilutor has in general, the following components:1. A propulsion system2. A control system3. A dispensing system\nPropulsion system\nThis is generally constituted of positive displacement systems as found in syringes. One or more selectable \nsyringes (with a varying capacity) is\/are used in the dilutor to control the volume to be mixed or diluted. The syringes\u2019 pistons are moved by a mechanism which controls their position. Aspirated volumes or deliveries are calculated by means of the following equation:\nWhere: \n\u2202 V =  fraction of the volume delivered by the syringe when the piston has a displacement   \u2202l.A =  piston area. The total volume aspirated or delivered is the corresponding \nintegral: \n where l\no and l1 correspond to the positions that defi  ne the \npiston\u2019s displacement.Controlling how the pistons move facilitates good control \nover the volumes handled. The displacement system is activated by an electric motor which moves a very precise nuts and screws system and changes the position of the piston. A set of valves controlling the aspiration and supply processes complements the syringes and their displacement systems. The confi  guration of the dilutor depends on the \nmodel and manufacturers. Control system\nModern dilutors have a control system which is automatic or controlled by microprocessors. The latter allow the following \nto be selected and controlled:1. Mixing processes and\/or dissolution of substances \n(programmable)\n2. Predefi  ned volume supply\n3. Supply or suction velocities4. Number of required cycles5. Size or volume of selected syringes6.

The pressure decreases until it reaches the vapour pre ssure of the fl  uid. This produces diverse phenomena such as vaporization of gases dissolved in the liquid or, in the case of water, the formation o f vapour bubbles collapsing after an \ninfi  nitesimal time lapse, perforating the surfaces of conducts in the immediate vicinity. This occurs in dilutors when using la rge capacity syringes with elevated \npropulsion speed. Concentration. A quantity measurement of a chemical substance present in a solution. The concept is expressed as the quantity of a substance dissolved into a \nsolvent. Concentration is expressed in diverse forms; the most common are: molarity [M], molality [m], normality [N], percentag e rate of solute. Dilution. To reduce the concentration of a solution by adding other fl  uids. The fl  uid added is known as the diluent . Adding the molecules of a liquid substance with \nthe molecules of another liquid substance.

The dilutor does not produce precise results. There is air in the fl  uid circuit. Verify that the feeding tubes are completely \nsubmerged inside the containers which contain the reagents. Confi  rm that the diff  erent connectors are adjusted.Verify that the syringes are correctly installed and \nthere are no leaks. Test to ensure that the tubes or valves have no leaks.Reduce the operational speed of the syringe to \neliminate cavitation problems. The delivery tube is incorrectly selected for the \nsyringe\u2019s capacity.Verify the recommended size of the tube used and its \nconnections. For small volumes, use the dimensions recommended by the manufacturer. A small air gap appears on the tip of the probe after \nthe fi  nal aspiration.The aspiration tube is dirty. Change or clean the aspiration tube. The aspiration mode is incorrect. Reduce the aspiration speed. Air is persistently present or there are constant leaks \nin the fl  uid trajectory.Cavitations are present in the system. The aspiration \nspeed is very high.Reduce the propulsion system\u2019s speed. Remember \nthat the more viscous the fl  uids, the lower the speed must be used to manipulate them. The connections are loose, worn out or defective. Adjust the connections by hand. Substitute to tubes \nwith dimensions corresponding with the fl  uids processed. The piston is defective or the syringe is damaged. Replace the piston or the syringe.There is a defective valve. Replace the valve. The dilutor is heating. There is inadequate ventilation. Check the ventilation. The room temperature is too high. Check the air conditioning system in the area.The work cycle is very intense. Use the dilutor with less intensity.CHAPTER 9  DILUTOR\n64BASIC DEFINITIONS\nCavitations. A phenomenon in fl  uids when a vacuum is created upon emptying a vessel. The pressure decreases until it reaches the vapour pre ssure of the fl  uid. This produces diverse phenomena such as vaporization of gases dissolved in the liquid or, in the case of water, the formation o f vapour bubbles collapsing after an \ninfi  nitesimal time lapse, perforating the surfaces of conducts in the immediate vicinity. This occurs in dilutors when using la rge capacity syringes with elevated \npropulsion speed. Concentration. A quantity measurement of a chemical substance present in a solution. The concept is expressed as the quantity of a substance dissolved into a \nsolvent. Concentration is expressed in diverse forms; the most common are: molarity [M], molality [m], normality [N], percentag e rate of solute. Dilution. To reduce the concentration of a solution by adding other fl  uids. The fl  uid added is known as the diluent . Adding the molecules of a liquid substance with \nthe molecules of another liquid substance. In order to determine the volume V1 of liquid needed to obtain V2 volume at a concen tration C2 from a stock solution of \nconcentration C1, the following equation is used:  \nDispenser. A device used for distributing liquids.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>A timer.4. An electronic thermometer with exactitude of 0.5\u00b0C for \nrefrigerated centrifuges. 5.<\/DOCUMENT>\n2.

Its purpose is to give a better \nunderstanding of the technical requirements regarding installation, use and maintenance of various types of equipment which play an important role in performing diagnostic testing. The manual also aims to provide support to personnel responsible for technical management, implementation of quality management and maintenance. Due to the diversity of origins, brands and models, this manual off  ers general recommendations. Equipment-specifi  c details \nare explained in depth in the maintenance and installation user manuals from manufacturers. These should be requested and ordered through the procurement processes of the individual agencies and professionals responsible for the acquisition of technology, or directly from the manufacturer. This manual was originally developed by the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) to support improved quality \nprogrammes which PAHO promotes in regional laboratories. The English version was produced by WHO to further expand support for quality programmes in other regions. The revised edition now includes 20 equipment groups selected to cover those most commonly used in low to medium technical complexity laboratories across the world. Given the diff  erences in \ntechnical complexity, brands and existing models, each chapter has been developed with basic equipment in mind, including new technology where relevant. The following information is included in each chapter: \n\u2022\u2022 Groups of equipment, organized by their generic names. Alternative names have also been included. \u2022\u2022 Photographs or diagrams, or a combination of both t o identify the type of equipment under consideration. \u2022\u2022 A brief explanation on the main uses or applications of the equipment in the laboratory. \u2022\u2022 A basic description of the principles by which the equipment operates with explanations of principles or physical and\/or \nchemical la ws which the interested reader can \u2013 or should study in depth. \u2022\u2022 Installation requirements with emphasis on the electrical aspects and the r equirements for safe installation and operation, \nincluding worldwide electrical standards. \u2022\u2022 Basic routine maintenance, classifi  ed according to the required frequency (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually \nor sporadically). The procedures are numbered and presented in the actual sequence in which these should take place (model-specifi  c procedures can be found in the manuals published by the manufacturers). \u2022\u2022 Troubleshooting tables with the most frequent problems aff  ecting the equipment with possible causes and actions that \nmay resolve these problems. \u2022\u2022 A list of basic defi  nitions of some of the specialized terms used.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Do not strike the electrode.

What could cause blockage in the system?","role":"user"},{"content":"To answer the question about what could cause blockage in the system, I will analyze the context provided step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify Potential Causes**: The context mentions several components of the system, including the lamp, ballast, ventilator, and HEPA filter. Each of these could potentially contribute to blockage.\n\n2. **Examine the Ventilator**: The context states that \"The ventilator is not blowing but the light is coming on.\" This indicates that the ventilator may not be functioning properly, which could lead to blockage.\n\n3. **Check for Defective Parts**: The context suggests that the ventilator's motor could be defective or disconnected. If the motor is not working, it would not be able to move air, leading to blockage.\n\n4. **Consider the HEPA Filter**: The context notes that \"Retention of particles in the HEPA filter has increased.\" This suggests that the filter is becoming clogged, which is a common cause of blockage in air systems.\n\n5. **Look at Other Areas**: The context also mentions \"There is blockage in the grids or return slots.\" This indicates that physical obstructions in these areas could also contribute to blockage.\n\n6. **Summarize Findings**: Based on the context, the potential causes of blockage in the system include:\n   - A defective or disconnected ventilator motor.\n   - Increased retention of particles in the HEPA filter.\n   - Blockage in the grids or return slots.\n\nNow, I will compile this information into a succinct answer.\n\n<ANSWER>: Blockage in the system could be caused by a defective or disconnected ventilator motor, increased retention of particles in the HEPA filter, or blockage in the grids or return slots.","role":"assistant"}]}

The enzyme reacts with the \nsubstrate and causes the solution to change in colour. This will indicate how much antigen-antibody complex is present at the end of the test. 8. Once the incubation time is completed, a reagent \nis added to stop the enzyme-substrate reaction and to prevent further changes in colour. This reagent is generally a diluted acid.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>On the outside and end of the inner tube is the anodized end. The reference electrode is usually made of the same type of material as the internal electrode. Both tubes, interior and exterior, contain a reference solution. Only the outer tube has contact with the measured solution through a porous cap which acts as a saline bridge. This device acts like a galvanized cell. The reference electrode \nis the internal tube of the pH meter probe, which cannot lose ions through interactions with the surrounding environment. Therefore as a reference, it remains static (unchangeable) during the measuring process. The external tube of the probe contains the medium which is allowed  to mix with the external environment. As a result, this tube must be fi lled periodically with a potassium chloride solution (KCI) \nfor restoring the capacity of the electrode which would otherwise be inhibited by a loss of ions and evaporation. The glass bulb on the lower part of the pH electrode acts \nas a measuring element and is covered with a layer of hydrated gel on its exterior and interior. Metallic sodium cations [Na\n+] are diff  used in the hydrated gel outside of \nthe glass and in the solution, while the hydrogen ions [H+] \nare diff  used in the gel. This gel makes the pH electrode \nion-selective:  Hydrogen ions [H+] cannot pass through the \nglass membrane of the pH electrode. Sodium ions [Na+] pass \nthrough and cause a change in free energy, which the pH meter measures. A brief explanation of the theory on how electrodes function is included in the appendix at the end of the chapter.pH METER COMPONENTS \nA pH meter generally has the following components: 1. The body of the instrument containing the circuits, \ncontrols, connectors, display screens and measuring scales. The following are among some of its most \nimportant components:\na) An ON and OFF switch. Not all pH meters have an \non and off   switch. Some simply have a cord with a \nplug which allows it to be connected to a suitable electrical outlet. b) Temperature control. This control allows \nadjustments according to the temperature of the solution measured. c) Calibration controls. Depending on the design, \npH meters possess one or two calibration buttons or dials. Normally these are identifi  ed by Cal 1  and \nCal 2 . If the pH meter is calibrated using only one \nsolution, the Cal 1 button is used; making sure that Cal 2 is set at a 100%. If the pH meter allows  two point calibrations, two known pH solutions covering the range of pH to be measured are used. In this case, the two controls are used (Cal 1 and Cal 2). In special cases, a three-point calibration must be done (using three known pH solutions). d) Mode selector.<\/DOCUMENT>\n1.

The mass in grams of this amount of a substance, numerically equal to the molecular weight of the substance, also called gram-molecular weight. pH. Measurement of the concentration of the hydrogen ion (H+) given in moles per litre (M) in a solution. The pH concept was proposed by S\u00f8rensen and Lindstr\u00f8m-\nLang in 1909 to facilitate expressing very low ion concentrations. It is defi  ned by the following equation:pH = \u2013log [H\n+]      or      [H+] = 10-pH \nIt measures the acidity of a solution. Example, in water the concentration of [H+] is 1.0 x 10-7 M resulting in pH = 7. This allows the range of concentrations from \n1 to 10-14 M, to be expressed from zero (0) to 14. There are diverse systems for measuring the acidity of a solution. An acidic substance  dissolved in water is capable \nof producing H+ ions. A basic substance dissolved in water is capable of producing [OH\u2013] (hydroxides) ions. An acid substance has a greater quantity of ions [H+] than pure water; a basic substance shows greater quantities of ions [OH\u2013] than pure water. The concentrations \nof substances are expressed in moles per litre. In pure water, the ion concentration [H+] and [OH\u2013] is 1.0 x 10\u20137 M, it is thus considered a neutral substance. In reality, it is a weak electrolyte that is dissociated \nfollowing the following equation:H\n2O  '  [H+][OH\u2013] \nIn all aqueous solutions there is a balance expressed as:   \n[H+][OH\u2013] = K \n     H2O\nIf the solution is diluted, the concentration of the non-dissociated water can be considered constant:\n[H+][OH\u2013] = [H2O]K = Ka\nThe new constant Ka is called a constant of dissociation or ionic product of water and its value is 1.0x10\u201314 at 25 \u00b0C. [H+][OH\u2013] = 1.0 x 10-14\nX x X = 1.0 x 10-14\nX2 = 1.0 x 10-14\nX = 1.0 x 10-7\nIn pure water the concentrations of H+ and OH\u2013 are 1.0 x 10\u20137 M, a very low concentration, given that the molar concentration of water is 55.4 mol\/litre.

The water distiller, also called distillation unit or water still, used in the laboratory, purifi  es running water by means of controlled \nvaporization and cooling processes. Upon applying thermal energy to water in a liquid phase by a warming process, it is changed into vapour. This allows the water molecules to separate from the molecules of other substances mixed or diluted. The water vapour is collected and passed through a condenser, where it is cooled and returned to the liquid phase. Then, the condensed water is collected into a diff  erent storage tank. Distilled water shows pure \ncharacteristics compared to running water; it is practically free of contaminating substances.PURPOSE OF THE WATER DISTILLER\nThe water distiller facilitates obtaining very pure water from potable wat er normally provided by the aqueduct services \nin urban centres. Distilled water is characterized by a lack of solids in suspension. It is used in multiple applications in centres which provide health services, especially in laboratory units, in washing, sterilization and dietetics. The more specialized the procedures are in the laboratory, the greater will be the level of purity required. For example: the preparation of reagents or biological material requires water of the highest quality. Distillation is one of the fundamental processes to achieve this (although it may not be the only one required). Water used in laboratories must be free of pyrogens, with a concentration of total solids no greater than 1 ppm, a pH value between 5.4 and 7.2 and an electrical resistance of at least 3 x 10\n5 ohm\/cm at 25 \u00b0C1. 1 Warming cabinets, sterilizers, and associated equipment , Division 11\u2013 \nEquipment, USACE\/NAVFAC\/ AFCESA, UFGS-11710, July 2003.

The pressure decreases until it reaches the vapour pre ssure of the fl  uid. This produces diverse phenomena such as vaporization of gases dissolved in the liquid or, in the case of water, the formation o f vapour bubbles collapsing after an \ninfi  nitesimal time lapse, perforating the surfaces of conducts in the immediate vicinity. This occurs in dilutors when using la rge capacity syringes with elevated \npropulsion speed. Concentration. A quantity measurement of a chemical substance present in a solution. The concept is expressed as the quantity of a substance dissolved into a \nsolvent. Concentration is expressed in diverse forms; the most common are: molarity [M], molality [m], normality [N], percentag e rate of solute. Dilution. To reduce the concentration of a solution by adding other fl  uids. The fl  uid added is known as the diluent . Adding the molecules of a liquid substance with \nthe molecules of another liquid substance. In order to determine the volume V1 of liquid needed to obtain V2 volume at a concen tration C2 from a stock solution of \nconcentration C1, the following equation is used:  \nDispenser.

This information, along with good use and care, helps to maintain laboratory equipment in optimal condition.MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n1The microplate reader also known as \u201cPhotometric \nmicro-plate reader or ELISA reader\u201d is a specialized spectrophotometer designed to read results of the ELISA test, a technique used to determine the presence of antibodies or specifi  c antigens in samples. The technique \nis based on the detection of an antigen or antibodies captured on a solid surface using direct or secondary, labelled antibodies, producing a reaction whose product can be read by the spectrophotometer. The word ELISA is the acronym for \u201cEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay\u201d . This chapter covers the use of microplate readers for ELISA testing. For additional information on the instrument principles of operation and maintenance, consult Chapter 11 discussing the spectrophotometer. PHOTOGRAPH OF MICROPLATE READER\nPURPOSE OF THE MICROPLATE READER\nThe microplate reader is used for reading the results of ELISA \ntests. This technique has a direct application in immunology and serology. Among other applications it confi  rms the \npresence of antibodies or antigens of an infectious agent in an organism, antibodies from a vaccine or auto-antibodies, for example in rheumatoid arthritis.OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThe microplate reader is a specialized spectrophotometer. Unlike the c onventional spectrophotometer which facilitates \nreadings on a wide range of wavelengths, the microplate reader has filters or diffraction gratings that limit the wavelength range to that used in ELISA, generally between 400 to 750 nm (nanometres). Some readers operate in the ultraviolet range and carry out analyses between 340 to 700 nm. The optical system exploited by many manufacturers uses optic fi  bres to supply light to the microplate wells \ncontaining the samples. The light beam, passing through the sample has a diameter ranging between 1 to 3 mm. A detection system detects the light coming from the sample, amplifi  es the signal and determines the sample\u2019s \nabsorbance. A reading system converts it into data allowing the test result interpretation. Some microplate readers use double beam light systems. Test samples are located in specially designed plates with \na specifi  c number of wells where the procedure or test is \ncarried out. Plates of 8 columns by 12 rows with a total of 96 wells are common. There are also plates with a greater number of wells. For specialized applications, the current trend is to increase the number of wells (384-well plates) to reduce the amount of reagents and samples used and a greater throughput. The location of the optical sensors of the microplate reader varies depending on the manufacturers: these can be located above the sample plate, or directly underneath the plate\u2019s wells. Nowadays microplate readers have controls regulated by \nmicroprocessors; connection interfaces to information systems; quality and process control programs, which by means of a computer, allow complete test automation.Chapter 1\nMicroplate Reader\nGMDN Code 37036\nECRI Code 16-979\nDenomination Photometric micro-plate reader\nPhoto courtesy of BioRad Laboratories CHAPTER 1  MICROPLATE READER\n2Equipment required for ELISA testing\nIn order to perform the ELISA technique, the following \nequipment is r equired:  \n1.

Potable water is used for feeding the vapour generator and for refrigerating the condenser\n2. 3. A distilled water connection. The distilled water produced \nis initially collected into a storage tank. In large capacity equipment, it is distributed to consumption points from the tank by means of a network.

Dilutor diagram    CHAPTER 9  DILUTOR\n60OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThe dilutor has various components which interact in a \ncoordinated manner to handle liquids and mix volumes \nwith great precision, which allows known solutions of between 1 \u00b5l and 25 ml to be prepared. The dilutor has in general, the following components:1. A propulsion system2. A control system3. A dispensing system\nPropulsion system\nThis is generally constituted of positive displacement systems as found in syringes. One or more selectable \nsyringes (with a varying capacity) is\/are used in the dilutor to control the volume to be mixed or diluted. The syringes\u2019 pistons are moved by a mechanism which controls their position. Aspirated volumes or deliveries are calculated by means of the following equation:\nWhere: \n\u2202 V =  fraction of the volume delivered by the syringe when the piston has a displacement   \u2202l.A =  piston area. The total volume aspirated or delivered is the corresponding \nintegral: \n where l\no and l1 correspond to the positions that defi  ne the \npiston\u2019s displacement.Controlling how the pistons move facilitates good control \nover the volumes handled. The displacement system is activated by an electric motor which moves a very precise nuts and screws system and changes the position of the piston. A set of valves controlling the aspiration and supply processes complements the syringes and their displacement systems. The confi  guration of the dilutor depends on the \nmodel and manufacturers. Control system\nModern dilutors have a control system which is automatic or controlled by microprocessors. The latter allow the following \nto be selected and controlled:1. Mixing processes and\/or dissolution of substances \n(programmable)\n2. Predefi  ned volume supply\n3. Supply or suction velocities4. Number of required cycles5. Size or volume of selected syringes6.

Dilutor controls    MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n61\nDispenser system\nThe dispenser system is composed of a set of high precision \nsyringes and devic es called dispensers, through which \nfl uids are supplied according to their volumes and selected \nvelocities. These syringes are selected and installed in the dilutor depending on the densities, viscosities, and volumes of fluids to be manipulated. The fluids are transported through flexible tubes, whose diameters, lengths and chemical compatibility are taken into account in the design and manufacturing process for suitability with the selected activity. These tubes are linked using connections manually adjustable. Normally, the syringes are classifi  ed according to \ntheir use (e.g. syringes for reagents, diluents, samples), and the volume these manipulate. The following table shows an example of how they are classifi  ed according to their size \nand managed volumes. Opposite, the components of the dispensing system (syringe \nand dispenser) are shown. INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS\nThe dilutor must be installed on a clean, dry and extremely levelled counter or work surface, far from areas where there \nmay be vapours which can aff  ect its functioning. There must be free space around the equipment for \nfacilitating ventilation and the passage of cables and interconnection lines and cables with the solvent containers, computers or supply systems. The space around the dilutor should be approximately 10 cm. There must be a 115 V, 60 Hz electrical outlet in good \ncondition with a ground pole or alternatively one of 220\u2013240 V, 50\/60 Hz, depending on the manufacturer\u2019s specifi  cations \nand\/or the electrical norms in the country of use.ROUTINE MAINTENANCE \nThe routine maintenance focuses mainly on eliminating contaminants which may accumulate inside the fluid \nmechanisms and\/or lines. The most common routines are the following:\nCleaning of exterior surfaces\nFrequency: Daily\nWarning:  Disconnect the dilutor from the electrical feed \noutlet before beginning the external cleaning process. 1. Clean the exterior surfaces using a clean piece of cloth \ndampened with a mild detergent mixed with water. 2. Lightly rub the surfaces of the dilutor and the \naccessories. 3. Dry the treated surfaces. Warning:  Avoid humidity from entering the compartment \nof the electrical and electronic components.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>There is a calibration error.

ROUTINE MAINTENANCE\nThe routine maintenance required by a centrifuge depends on multiple fac tors such as the incorporated technology, \nusage intensity, training of users, quality of the electrical feed and environmental conditions. The following are general recommendations regarding adequate use and most common maintenance for guaranteeing correct operation. The routines or specialized repairs will depend on manufacturers\u2019 recommendations for each brand and model. Always disinfect the rotor bowl, centrifuge head, buckets and trunnion rings as applicable before any servicing of centrifuges used to prepare clinical or infectious samples. Priority recommendation. Verify that only qualifi  ed personnel \ntrained and familiar with the use, care, risks and handling of the centrifuge operates it. It is the laboratory directors\u2019 responsibility to supervise and take necessary precautions so that personnel operating centrifuges understand the implications of working with such equipment. APPROPRIATE MANAGEMENT AND STORAGE RECOMMEND ATIONS\n1\nRotors\n1. Register the date of purchase of each one of the rotors, \nincluding inf ormation related to the serial and model \nnumber. 2.

An electrical connection equipped with control \nand safety devices complying with the national and international electrical standards used in the laboratory, adapted to the capacity of the resistive elements of the distiller. In general, the voltage is 220-240 V, 50\/60 Hz. Note:  Always verify manufacturer\u2019s recommendations on \ninstallation to ensure the distiller is operating according to the specifi  cations. ROUTINE MAINTENANCE \nThe maintenance depends on the design and capacity of \nthe distiller . The maintenance described in this manual \nfocuses on a distiller equipped with a stainless steel vapour generator tank with immersion resistors and a condenser refrigerated through a ventilator impelling air (on or through the condenser\u2019s diff  using fi  ns). Warning:  Before carrying out an inspection or routine \nmaintenance, verify that the distiller is turned off and disconnected from the electrical source. Inspection and cleaning of the vapour generator tank\nFrequency: Monthly1.

A platform of high \ninertia, isolated from the structures located in its vicinity is ideal to reduce the eff  ect of vibrations from certain \nequipment such as centrifuges and refrigerators. There must be a large enough area for installing the balance and any auxiliary equipment needed during the weighing processes. Likewise, the space required for cables such as the interconnection, electrical current cables and the information system connection to the printer must be anticipated. 3. Avoid installing equipment which produces elevated \nmagnetic fi  elds or vibrations like centrifuges, electrical \nmotors, compressors and generators in its vicinity. 4. Avoid locating it directly under the air-conditioning \nsystem (air currents) and sunlight. 5. An electrical outlet which complies with the current \nelectrical standards in the country or the laboratory. It must be in good condition and equipped with a ground pole and switches.Electronic balance operation\nThe operation of a modern electronic balance is clearly detailed in its operat or\u2019s manual from the manufacturer. In \ngeneral, it must conform to the following procedure:1. Allow the balance to equilibrate with the environment \nwhere it is installed. 2. Allow the balance to warm-up before initiating activities. Normally it is suffi   cient to have it connected to the \nelectrical feed system. Some manufacturers suggest at least 20 minutes from the moment it is energized until use. Analytical balances Class 1 require at least 2 hours for warming before initiating use. Verify that the balance is calibrated. Electronic \nbalances generally have a factory-made calibration stored in memory which can be used if it does not have calibration masses. If calibration is required, use calibrated masses as indicated by the manufacturer. The calibrated masses must conform or exceed the ASTM tolerances. For general information, the following table shows the accepted tolerance for the ASTM Class 1\n1 \nmasses. 3.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>4.

Its purpose is to give a better \nunderstanding of the technical requirements regarding installation, use and maintenance of various types of equipment which play an important role in performing diagnostic testing. The manual also aims to provide support to personnel responsible for technical management, implementation of quality management and maintenance. Due to the diversity of origins, brands and models, this manual off  ers general recommendations. Equipment-specifi  c details \nare explained in depth in the maintenance and installation user manuals from manufacturers. These should be requested and ordered through the procurement processes of the individual agencies and professionals responsible for the acquisition of technology, or directly from the manufacturer. This manual was originally developed by the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) to support improved quality \nprogrammes which PAHO promotes in regional laboratories. The English version was produced by WHO to further expand support for quality programmes in other regions. The revised edition now includes 20 equipment groups selected to cover those most commonly used in low to medium technical complexity laboratories across the world. Given the diff  erences in \ntechnical complexity, brands and existing models, each chapter has been developed with basic equipment in mind, including new technology where relevant. The following information is included in each chapter: \n\u2022\u2022 Groups of equipment, organized by their generic names. Alternative names have also been included. \u2022\u2022 Photographs or diagrams, or a combination of both t o identify the type of equipment under consideration. \u2022\u2022 A brief explanation on the main uses or applications of the equipment in the laboratory. \u2022\u2022 A basic description of the principles by which the equipment operates with explanations of principles or physical and\/or \nchemical la ws which the interested reader can \u2013 or should study in depth. \u2022\u2022 Installation requirements with emphasis on the electrical aspects and the r equirements for safe installation and operation, \nincluding worldwide electrical standards. \u2022\u2022 Basic routine maintenance, classifi  ed according to the required frequency (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually \nor sporadically). The procedures are numbered and presented in the actual sequence in which these should take place (model-specifi  c procedures can be found in the manuals published by the manufacturers). \u2022\u2022 Troubleshooting tables with the most frequent problems aff  ecting the equipment with possible causes and actions that \nmay resolve these problems. \u2022\u2022 A list of basic defi  nitions of some of the specialized terms used.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Check the calibration.

This information, along with good use and care, helps to maintain laboratory equipment in optimal condition.MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n1The microplate reader also known as \u201cPhotometric \nmicro-plate reader or ELISA reader\u201d is a specialized spectrophotometer designed to read results of the ELISA test, a technique used to determine the presence of antibodies or specifi  c antigens in samples. The technique \nis based on the detection of an antigen or antibodies captured on a solid surface using direct or secondary, labelled antibodies, producing a reaction whose product can be read by the spectrophotometer. The word ELISA is the acronym for \u201cEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay\u201d . This chapter covers the use of microplate readers for ELISA testing. For additional information on the instrument principles of operation and maintenance, consult Chapter 11 discussing the spectrophotometer. PHOTOGRAPH OF MICROPLATE READER\nPURPOSE OF THE MICROPLATE READER\nThe microplate reader is used for reading the results of ELISA \ntests. This technique has a direct application in immunology and serology. Among other applications it confi  rms the \npresence of antibodies or antigens of an infectious agent in an organism, antibodies from a vaccine or auto-antibodies, for example in rheumatoid arthritis.OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThe microplate reader is a specialized spectrophotometer. Unlike the c onventional spectrophotometer which facilitates \nreadings on a wide range of wavelengths, the microplate reader has filters or diffraction gratings that limit the wavelength range to that used in ELISA, generally between 400 to 750 nm (nanometres). Some readers operate in the ultraviolet range and carry out analyses between 340 to 700 nm. The optical system exploited by many manufacturers uses optic fi  bres to supply light to the microplate wells \ncontaining the samples. The light beam, passing through the sample has a diameter ranging between 1 to 3 mm. A detection system detects the light coming from the sample, amplifi  es the signal and determines the sample\u2019s \nabsorbance. A reading system converts it into data allowing the test result interpretation. Some microplate readers use double beam light systems. Test samples are located in specially designed plates with \na specifi  c number of wells where the procedure or test is \ncarried out. Plates of 8 columns by 12 rows with a total of 96 wells are common. There are also plates with a greater number of wells. For specialized applications, the current trend is to increase the number of wells (384-well plates) to reduce the amount of reagents and samples used and a greater throughput. The location of the optical sensors of the microplate reader varies depending on the manufacturers: these can be located above the sample plate, or directly underneath the plate\u2019s wells. Nowadays microplate readers have controls regulated by \nmicroprocessors; connection interfaces to information systems; quality and process control programs, which by means of a computer, allow complete test automation.Chapter 1\nMicroplate Reader\nGMDN Code 37036\nECRI Code 16-979\nDenomination Photometric micro-plate reader\nPhoto courtesy of BioRad Laboratories CHAPTER 1  MICROPLATE READER\n2Equipment required for ELISA testing\nIn order to perform the ELISA technique, the following \nequipment is r equired:  \n1.

This \nmust be done according to the process outlined by the manufacturer or a specialized fi  rm must be contracted \nto do so. Electronic balances\nThe electronic balances have three basic components:1. A weighing plate. The object to be weighed placed \non the weighing plate exercises a pressure distributed randomly over the surface of the plate. By means of a transfer mechanism (levers, supports, guides), the weight\u2019s load is concentrated on a simple force [F] which can be measured. [F = \u222bP\u2202a]. The pressure\u2019s integral part \non the area allows the force to be calculated.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>3. Turn the functions selector from Standby position to \npH position. 3.1 T his action connects the electrode to the pH \nmeasuring scale in the pH meter. 3.2 Adjust the meter to read the pH of the calibration \nsolution using the button marked Cal 1. This enables the meter to read the pH of the calibration solution. For example: For a solution at pH = 7, the needle can oscillate slightly in units of 0.1 pH; on average, the reading should be 7. The reading of the meter (reading scale) should be done perpendicularly, to avoid or eliminate parallel-type errors (reading errors produced by the shadow of the meter\u2019s needle, visible on the mirror of the reading scale). The pH meter is then ready (calibrated), to carry out the correct pH readings.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Low cost DC voltmeter. Permits readings in millivolts. The voltage read is 10 \ntimes that of the cell, allowing a resolution of 0.1 millivolts. The reading is done by using carbon\/quinhydrone \nelectrodes.Description of typical control circuit elements  \n* Diff  erent voltage specifi  cations are applicable in certain regions of the World. INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS\nThe pH meter works using electric current with the following \ncharac teristics. Power:  Single phase Voltage: 110 V or 220-230 V Frequencies; \n50-60Hz depending on the World region. There is also portable pH meters powered with batteries. GENERAL CALIBRATION PROCEDURE\npH analyzers must be calibrated before use to guarantee \nthe qualit y and accuracy of the readings following these \nprocedures:1. One point calibration. This is carried out for normal \nworking conditions and for normal use. It uses one known pH reference solution. 2. Two point calibration. This is done prior to performing \nvery precise measurements. It uses two known pH reference solutions. It is also done if the instrument is used sporadically and its maintenance is not carried out frequently.Description of the process\nFrequency: Daily1. Calibr ate the pH meter using one known pH solution \n(one point calibration). 1.1 Connect the equipment to an electrical outlet with \nsuitable voltage. 1.2 A djust the temperature selector to the \nenvironmental temperature. 1.3 Adjust the meter.1.4 Remove the electrodes from the storage container. The electrodes must always be stored in a suitable solution. Some can be maintained in distilled water, others must be kept in a diff  erent solution \nas their manufacturers recommend\n1. If for some \nreason, the electrode becomes dry, it is necessary to soak it for at least 24 hours before use. 1.5 R inse the electrode with distilled water in an empty \nbeaker. 1.6 Dry the electrode with material able to absorb \nresidual liquid on its surface, without impregnating the electrode. To avoid possible contamination, the electrodes must be rinsed between diff  erent \nsolutions. 1 Verify the type of buff  er solution recommended by the electrode \nmanufacturer.MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n172. Place electrodes in the calibration solution. 2.1 Submerge the electrode in the standardization \nsolution in such a manner that its lower extremity does not touch the bottom of the beaker. This decreases the risk of breaking the electrode. If the test requires that the solution be kept in motion using the magnetic agitator, special care must be taken so that the agitation rod does not hit the electrode as this could break it. Buff  er solution \nis used as a calibration solution, because its pH is known and therefore will still be maintained even if a little contamination occurs. In general, a solution of pH = 7 is used for this purpose\n1.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>3. Replacing ventilators. (*) 4. Replacing the HEPA fi  lter (*).

Emission of light or luminescence resulting directly from a chemical reaction at environmental temperatures. ELISA  (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay). Biochemical technique used mainly in Immunology to detect the presence of an antibody or an antigen in a \nsample. ELISA plate.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>The vacuum may be supplied by external and internal pumps. Extraction is done by a set of needles mounted on the washer\/dryer\u2019s head. The number of needles varies from one to three, according to the washer model used. If it uses only one needle, the washing and \nextraction operation is done with this single needle. If it uses two needles, one is used for supplying the washing solution and the other for extraction. If it uses three needles, the fi  rst is used for supplying the washing \nsolution, the second for extraction and the third for controlling (extracting) any excess volume in the well. Generally, the extraction needle is longer than the supply needle, which enables it to advance (vertically) up to a height ranging between 0.3 and 0.5 mm from the bottom of the well. \u2022\u2022 Advance sub-system. This is composed of a \nmechanism which moves the supply and extraction head horizontally to reach each well in the ELISA plate. When the horizontal movement to the following row occurs, there is a vertical movement towards the well to dispense or extract the washing solution. There are washers which carry out these operations in a simultaneous manner.The sub-systems previously described are shown in Figure \n2. Figure 3 shows the diff  erent types of wells most commonly \nfound in microplates. Each kind of well is suitable for a particular type of test. Washing process\nThe washing of the microplate is one of the stages of the ELISA t echnique. Special solutions are used in the washing \nsteps. Among those most commonly used is phosphate buff er solution or PBS. The phosphate buff  er solution has a \nstability of 2 months if kept at 4 \u00b0C. It is estimated that 1 to 3 litres of solution is required for washing one microplate and that 300 \u00b5l is used in each well per cycle. Washing can \nbe done manually, but it is preferable to use an automated microplate washer for a better throughput and to minimize handling of potentially contaminated substances. Among the washing processes used by microplate washers \nare featured:\n\u2022\u2022 Aspir ation from top to bottom. When the aspiration \nphase is initiated, the needles move vertically and the aspiration is initiated immediately as these enter into the liquid. The process continues until the needles reach their lowest position very close to the bottom of the wells. At this point they are stopped in order to avoid suctioning the air that should fl  ow against the \ninterior lateral walls of the wells. This type of aspiration prevents air currents from drying the bound protein on the surface of the wells.

Well pro\ufb01  les MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n9\u2022\u2022 Simultaneous distribution and aspiration. In certain \ntypes of washer, the washing and aspiration systems operate simultaneously, generating a controlled turbulence inside the well which removes the unbound substances during the incubations. \u2022\u2022 Aspir ation from the base of the wells. In this system, \nthe aspiration of the fluid contained in the wells is performed initially with the aspiration needles in a position very close to the bottom, immediately beginning a suctioning cycle, usually time-controlled. This system may aspirate air if there are diff  erences in \nthe levels of the tanks. Washer calibration\nThe microplate washer is critical for guaranteeing that the ELISA t echnique performs as expected. The alignment to \nbe taken into account for the eff  ective functioning of the \nequipment is presented next:\n\u2022\u2022 Position of the needles (supply and aspiration head). The horizontal and vertical position adjustment with respect to the wells must be verifi  ed carefully. If the \nplate has fl  at bottom wells, the supply needle must be \nchecked to see that it is situated very close to the well\u2019s wall. If the bottom is round or V-shaped, the suction needle should be located in the centre of the well: upon the vertical movement, a needle-base distance is maintained in the well, usually between 0.3 to 0.5 mm. The needles must never be allowed to touch the bottom of the wells to avoid mechanical interferences between the needle point and the well\u2019s base during the aspiration function. \u2022\u2022 Aspir ation time. Appropriately adjust the aspiration \ntime so that a solution fi  lm adhered to the well\u2019s wall \ncan fl  ow towards the bottom. Avoid very long time lapses to prevent the coating on the wells from drying up. Check that the suction system\u2019s needles are clean (free of obstructions). \u2022\u2022 Distributed V olume. Check that the volume distributed \nis as close as possible to the maximum capacity of the well; confi  rm that all the wells are fi  lled uniformly (at \nthe same level). Verify that the distributing needles are clean (free of obstructions). \u2022\u2022 Vacuum. The suctioning system must be calibrated \neffi  ciently. If the vacuum is too strong, the test can \nbe altered. In fact, it could dry out the wells and considerably weaken the enzyme activity in the wells and completely alter the test result. The majority of washers function with a vacuum ranging between 60 and 70% of atmospheric pressure. In some washers, the vacuum is made in an external pump which operates as an accessory of the washer. Its operation is controlled by the washer, which means that the vacuum pump operates only when required. Washing process veri\ufb01  cation \nTo verify that the washing process is done according to \nthe specifications of ELISA t echniques, manufacturers \nof ELISA tests have developed procedures to be carried out regularly. One of the controls\n1 is based on using the \nperoxidase reagent, which is dispensed using a pipette in the plate wells to be read at 405, 450 and 492 nm. At once the wells are washed and a colourless substrate is added (TMB\/H\n2O2\u2013Tetramethylbenzidine\/Hydrogen Peroxide). Whatever conjugate remains will hydrolyze the enzyme and the chromogen will change to blue. After stopping the reaction with acid, the TMB will turn yellow again. The resulting colour intensity is directly related to the washing process effi   ciency. INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS\nFor the microplate washer to operate correctly, the following \nis nec essary: \n1.

Air velocity on entering the cabinet: 50.8 cm\/s. 3.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>On the outside and end of the inner tube is the anodized end. The reference electrode is usually made of the same type of material as the internal electrode. Both tubes, interior and exterior, contain a reference solution. Only the outer tube has contact with the measured solution through a porous cap which acts as a saline bridge. This device acts like a galvanized cell. The reference electrode \nis the internal tube of the pH meter probe, which cannot lose ions through interactions with the surrounding environment. Therefore as a reference, it remains static (unchangeable) during the measuring process. The external tube of the probe contains the medium which is allowed  to mix with the external environment. As a result, this tube must be fi lled periodically with a potassium chloride solution (KCI) \nfor restoring the capacity of the electrode which would otherwise be inhibited by a loss of ions and evaporation. The glass bulb on the lower part of the pH electrode acts \nas a measuring element and is covered with a layer of hydrated gel on its exterior and interior. Metallic sodium cations [Na\n+] are diff  used in the hydrated gel outside of \nthe glass and in the solution, while the hydrogen ions [H+] \nare diff  used in the gel. This gel makes the pH electrode \nion-selective:  Hydrogen ions [H+] cannot pass through the \nglass membrane of the pH electrode. Sodium ions [Na+] pass \nthrough and cause a change in free energy, which the pH meter measures. A brief explanation of the theory on how electrodes function is included in the appendix at the end of the chapter.pH METER COMPONENTS \nA pH meter generally has the following components: 1. The body of the instrument containing the circuits, \ncontrols, connectors, display screens and measuring scales. The following are among some of its most \nimportant components:\na) An ON and OFF switch. Not all pH meters have an \non and off   switch. Some simply have a cord with a \nplug which allows it to be connected to a suitable electrical outlet. b) Temperature control. This control allows \nadjustments according to the temperature of the solution measured. c) Calibration controls. Depending on the design, \npH meters possess one or two calibration buttons or dials. Normally these are identifi  ed by Cal 1  and \nCal 2 . If the pH meter is calibrated using only one \nsolution, the Cal 1 button is used; making sure that Cal 2 is set at a 100%. If the pH meter allows  two point calibrations, two known pH solutions covering the range of pH to be measured are used. In this case, the two controls are used (Cal 1 and Cal 2). In special cases, a three-point calibration must be done (using three known pH solutions). d) Mode selector.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>3.<\/DOCUMENT>\n3.

The \ncentrifuge is designed to use the centrifugal force generated in rotational movements to separate the constitutive elements of a mixture. There is a wide range of centrifuges capable of serving specifi  c industry and research needs. This \nchapter focuses on standing centrifuges normally used in public health and clinical laboratories. PHOTOGRAPH OF CENTRIFUGEPURPOSE OF THE CENTRIFUGE\nThe centrifuge uses centrifugal force (the force generated \nwhen an objec t rotates around a single point), for separating \nsolids suspended in a liquid by sedimentation, or liquids of diverse density. The rotational movements allow forces much greater than gravity to be generated in controlled periods of time. In the laboratory, centrifuges are generally used in processes such as the separation of solid components from biological liquids through sedimentation and in particular of blood components: red cells, white cells, platelets among others and for conducting multiple tests and treatments.There are several kinds of centrifuges. The most widely used in public health, surveillance and clinical laboratories are the table-top centrifuge, the ultracentrifuge, the haeamatocrit centrifuge and the standing centrifuge. OPERATION PRINCIPLES \nCentrifuges represent a practical application of Newton\u2019s law of motion. When a body of mass [m] turns around \na central point [O], it is subjected to a centripetal  force \n[N] directed towards the rotation axis with a magnitude N = m\u03c9\n2R, where [m] is the mass of the body, [R] is the radius \nand \u03c9 is the angular speed. Centrifuges possess a rotating axis on which is mounted a rotor with sample receiving compartments. Tangential speed is defi  ned by the following \nequation: VT=\u03c9R. Photo courtesy of Beckman CoulterCHAPTER 7  CENTRIFUGE\n46When the system spins at a speed of \u03c9 radians per second, \nthe samples are subjected to the centrifugal force Fp of the \nsame magnitude as N, but in an opposite direction. The \nfi gure shown below1 features a diagram of the concept, \nof its actual application and of the obtained result. This Fp force acts on particles in the substance centrifuged, \ncausing them to separate as a result of diff  erences in density. Denser particles will settle at the bottom of the tube in shorter periods of time, while lighter ones require longer periods of time, settling onto those of greater density. The relationship between the centrifugal acceleration [\u03c9\n2r ] to a \ngiven radius [r] and the force of gravity [g] is known as the relative centrifugal fi  eld or [RCF]\n2. RCF =r\u03c92\ng\nThe RCF is the tool which allows rotors of different \nspecifi  cations to be compared when equivalent centrifugal \neff ects are required. COMPONENTS OF THE CENTRIFUGE \nThe most important components of a centrifuge are the \nfollowing3:\nThe electric\/electronic control which generally has the following elements:1. On and off control, operation time control (timer), \nrotation speed control (in some centrifuges), temperature control (in refrigerated centrifuges), vibration control (safety mechanism) and brake system.2.

Verify the functioning of the refrigeration system in \nrefrigerated centrifuges. The following are the most important activities:\na) Check the selected temperatures. These should \nnot vary by more than 3 \u00b0C from the temperatures measured on the digital thermometer. b) Verify the state of the air intake filter. If the \nfi  lter is obstructed, clean or substitute with an equivalent. c) Conduct a detailed cleaning of the diff  using wing of \nthe condenser to eliminate the fi  lth deposited.

OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThe biological safety cabinet is a chamber generally constructed of steel. It has a front glass window of adjustable \nheight, a ventilation system with an electrical motor, a ventilator and a set of ducts which while functioning, generate a negative pressure condition inside the cabinet. This forces the air to fl  ow from inside the cabinet through \nthe front opening to generate a curtain of air protecting the operator. Internally, the air is conducted through a series of grids and ducts to be finally treated in HEPA\n1  \nfi lters. Depending on the design of the cabinet, the air is \nrecycled inside the laboratory or extracted and renewed in diverse proportions. The air fl  ow, which in Class II cabinets \nmoves from the fi  lter towards the work surface, is laminar. A \nsummary of the existing type of cabinets and their principal characteristics is presented next. 1 HEPA: High Effi   ciency Particulate Air.

If this is the case, invert the plate (180\u00b0) and repeat the reading to rule out that diff  erences are \nattributed to the plate itself. In general, it is accepted that the instrument does not need further calibration if the plate results are as expected at two wavelengths. 3. Verify if the reader requires calibration. If so, proceed \nwith the calibration following the routine outlined by the manufacturer, verifying that the reading\u2019s linearity is maintained as rigorously as possible. 4. If the instrument does not have a calibration plate, verify \nit by placing a coloured solution in the wells of a plate and immediately carry out a complete reading. Then invert the plate 180\u00b0 and read the plate again. If both readings display identical, average values in each row, the reader is calibrated. 5. Verify that the reader is calibrated, column by column. Place a clean, empty plate and carry out a reading.

The water distiller, also called distillation unit or water still, used in the laboratory, purifi  es running water by means of controlled \nvaporization and cooling processes. Upon applying thermal energy to water in a liquid phase by a warming process, it is changed into vapour. This allows the water molecules to separate from the molecules of other substances mixed or diluted. The water vapour is collected and passed through a condenser, where it is cooled and returned to the liquid phase. Then, the condensed water is collected into a diff  erent storage tank. Distilled water shows pure \ncharacteristics compared to running water; it is practically free of contaminating substances.PURPOSE OF THE WATER DISTILLER\nThe water distiller facilitates obtaining very pure water from potable wat er normally provided by the aqueduct services \nin urban centres. Distilled water is characterized by a lack of solids in suspension. It is used in multiple applications in centres which provide health services, especially in laboratory units, in washing, sterilization and dietetics. The more specialized the procedures are in the laboratory, the greater will be the level of purity required. For example: the preparation of reagents or biological material requires water of the highest quality. Distillation is one of the fundamental processes to achieve this (although it may not be the only one required). Water used in laboratories must be free of pyrogens, with a concentration of total solids no greater than 1 ppm, a pH value between 5.4 and 7.2 and an electrical resistance of at least 3 x 10\n5 ohm\/cm at 25 \u00b0C1. 1 Warming cabinets, sterilizers, and associated equipment , Division 11\u2013 \nEquipment, USACE\/NAVFAC\/ AFCESA, UFGS-11710, July 2003.

ROUTINE MAINTENANCE\nThe routine maintenance required by a centrifuge depends on multiple fac tors such as the incorporated technology, \nusage intensity, training of users, quality of the electrical feed and environmental conditions. The following are general recommendations regarding adequate use and most common maintenance for guaranteeing correct operation. The routines or specialized repairs will depend on manufacturers\u2019 recommendations for each brand and model. Always disinfect the rotor bowl, centrifuge head, buckets and trunnion rings as applicable before any servicing of centrifuges used to prepare clinical or infectious samples. Priority recommendation. Verify that only qualifi  ed personnel \ntrained and familiar with the use, care, risks and handling of the centrifuge operates it.

It must be taken into account that the weight is the force which the gravitational fi  eld exercises on a body\u2019s mass, this force being the product of the mass \nby the local acceleration of gravity [F = m x g]. The term local is used to emphasize that this acceleration depends on factors such as the geographical latitude, altitude and the Earth\u2019s density where the measurement is taken. This force is measured in Newtons.

In the laboratory, the balance is used \nfor weighing as part of quality control activities (on devices like pipettes), in the preparation of mixtures of components in predefined proportions and in the determination of specifi  c densities or weights. OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThere are diff  erences in design, principles and criteria of \nmetrology amongst balances. At present, there are two large groups of balances: mechanical and electronic balances. Mechanical balances \nThe following are some of the more common ones: 1. Spring balance. Its function is based on a mechanical \nproperty of springs as the force exercised on a spring is proportional to the spring\u2019s elasticity constant [k], multiplied by its elongation [x] [F = -kx]. The greater the mass [m] placed on the balance\u2019s plate, the greater the elongation will be, given that the elongation is proportional to the mass and the spring\u2019s constant. The calibration of a spring balance depends on the force of gravity acting on the object weighed. This type of balance is used when great precision is not necessary. 2. Sliding weight balance. This type of balance is \nequipped with two known weights which can be moved on setting scales (one macro, the other micro). Upon placing a substance of unknown mass on the tray, its weight is determined by moving the weight on both setting scales until the equilibrium position is reached. At this point, the weight is obtained by adding both quantities indicated by the sliding masses\u2019 position on the scale. 3. Analytical balance. This balance functions by comparing \nknown weight masses with that of a substance of unknown weight. It is composed of a base on a bar or symmetrical lever, maintained by a blade-like support on a central point called a fulcrum. At its ends, there are stirrups, also supported with blades which allow these to oscillate smoothly. From there, two plates are suspended. Certifi  ed weights are placed on one \nof the plates and unknown weights on the other. The balance has a securing system or lock, which allows the main lever to remain stable when not in use or when it is necessary to modify the counter-weights. The balance is inside an external box which protects it from interferences, such as air currents. Analytical balances can weigh ten thousandths of a gram (0.0001 g) or 100 thousandths of a gram (0.00001 g). This type of balance generally has a capacity of up to 200 grams.

Analytical balance  MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n23It is necessary to have a set of certifi  ed masses. The set is \ngenerally composed of the following pieces:\n4. Upper plate balance (Top loading or parallel guidance \nbalance). This type of balance has a loading plate located \non its upper part, supported by a column maintained in a vertical position by two pairs of guides with fl  exible \nconnections. The eff  ect of the force produced by the \nmass is transmitted from a point on the vertical column directly or by some mechanical means to the loading cell. The requirement with this type of mechanism is that parallel guides must be maintained with exactitude of up to \u00b1 1  \u00b5m. Deviations in parallelism cause an error known \nas lateral load (when the mass being weighed shows diff erences if the reading is taken at the centre of the \nplate or on one of its sides). The diagram shown below explains the operation principle some manufacturers have introduced in electronic balances.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Protein that accelerates (catalyses) chemical reactions.

Extraction is done by a set of needles mounted on the washer\/dryer\u2019s head. The number of needles varies from one to three, according to the washer model used. If it uses only one needle, the washing and \nextraction operation is done with this single needle. If it uses two needles, one is used for supplying the washing solution and the other for extraction. If it uses three needles, the fi  rst is used for supplying the washing \nsolution, the second for extraction and the third for controlling (extracting) any excess volume in the well. Generally, the extraction needle is longer than the supply needle, which enables it to advance (vertically) up to a height ranging between 0.3 and 0.5 mm from the bottom of the well. \u2022\u2022 Advance sub-system. This is composed of a \nmechanism which moves the supply and extraction head horizontally to reach each well in the ELISA plate. When the horizontal movement to the following row occurs, there is a vertical movement towards the well to dispense or extract the washing solution. There are washers which carry out these operations in a simultaneous manner.The sub-systems previously described are shown in Figure \n2. Figure 3 shows the diff  erent types of wells most commonly \nfound in microplates. Each kind of well is suitable for a particular type of test. Washing process\nThe washing of the microplate is one of the stages of the ELISA t echnique. Special solutions are used in the washing \nsteps. Among those most commonly used is phosphate buff er solution or PBS. The phosphate buff  er solution has a \nstability of 2 months if kept at 4 \u00b0C. It is estimated that 1 to 3 litres of solution is required for washing one microplate and that 300 \u00b5l is used in each well per cycle. Washing can \nbe done manually, but it is preferable to use an automated microplate washer for a better throughput and to minimize handling of potentially contaminated substances. Among the washing processes used by microplate washers \nare featured:\n\u2022\u2022 Aspir ation from top to bottom. When the aspiration \nphase is initiated, the needles move vertically and the aspiration is initiated immediately as these enter into the liquid. The process continues until the needles reach their lowest position very close to the bottom of the wells. At this point they are stopped in order to avoid suctioning the air that should fl  ow against the \ninterior lateral walls of the wells. This type of aspiration prevents air currents from drying the bound protein on the surface of the wells.

In certain \ntypes of washer, the washing and aspiration systems operate simultaneously, generating a controlled turbulence inside the well which removes the unbound substances during the incubations. \u2022\u2022 Aspir ation from the base of the wells. In this system, \nthe aspiration of the fluid contained in the wells is performed initially with the aspiration needles in a position very close to the bottom, immediately beginning a suctioning cycle, usually time-controlled. This system may aspirate air if there are diff  erences in \nthe levels of the tanks. Washer calibration\nThe microplate washer is critical for guaranteeing that the ELISA t echnique performs as expected. The alignment to \nbe taken into account for the eff  ective functioning of the \nequipment is presented next:\n\u2022\u2022 Position of the needles (supply and aspiration head). The horizontal and vertical position adjustment with respect to the wells must be verifi  ed carefully. If the \nplate has fl  at bottom wells, the supply needle must be \nchecked to see that it is situated very close to the well\u2019s wall. If the bottom is round or V-shaped, the suction needle should be located in the centre of the well: upon the vertical movement, a needle-base distance is maintained in the well, usually between 0.3 to 0.5 mm. The needles must never be allowed to touch the bottom of the wells to avoid mechanical interferences between the needle point and the well\u2019s base during the aspiration function. \u2022\u2022 Aspir ation time. Appropriately adjust the aspiration \ntime so that a solution fi  lm adhered to the well\u2019s wall \ncan fl  ow towards the bottom. Avoid very long time lapses to prevent the coating on the wells from drying up. Check that the suction system\u2019s needles are clean (free of obstructions). \u2022\u2022 Distributed V olume. Check that the volume distributed \nis as close as possible to the maximum capacity of the well; confi  rm that all the wells are fi  lled uniformly (at \nthe same level). Verify that the distributing needles are clean (free of obstructions). \u2022\u2022 Vacuum. The suctioning system must be calibrated \neffi  ciently. If the vacuum is too strong, the test can \nbe altered. In fact, it could dry out the wells and considerably weaken the enzyme activity in the wells and completely alter the test result. The majority of washers function with a vacuum ranging between 60 and 70% of atmospheric pressure. In some washers, the vacuum is made in an external pump which operates as an accessory of the washer. Its operation is controlled by the washer, which means that the vacuum pump operates only when required. Washing process veri\ufb01  cation \nTo verify that the washing process is done according to \nthe specifications of ELISA t echniques, manufacturers \nof ELISA tests have developed procedures to be carried out regularly. One of the controls\n1 is based on using the \nperoxidase reagent, which is dispensed using a pipette in the plate wells to be read at 405, 450 and 492 nm. At once the wells are washed and a colourless substrate is added (TMB\/H\n2O2\u2013Tetramethylbenzidine\/Hydrogen Peroxide). Whatever conjugate remains will hydrolyze the enzyme and the chromogen will change to blue. After stopping the reaction with acid, the TMB will turn yellow again. The resulting colour intensity is directly related to the washing process effi   ciency. INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS\nFor the microplate washer to operate correctly, the following \nis nec essary: \n1. A clean, dust-free environment.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>To protect the environment. The cabinets are used for routine work related to pathogens \n(parasites, bacteria, virus, fungus), cell culture and under very precise conditions, the management of toxic agents. OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThe biological safety cabinet is a chamber generally constructed of steel. It has a front glass window of adjustable \nheight, a ventilation system with an electrical motor, a ventilator and a set of ducts which while functioning, generate a negative pressure condition inside the cabinet. This forces the air to fl  ow from inside the cabinet through \nthe front opening to generate a curtain of air protecting the operator. Internally, the air is conducted through a series of grids and ducts to be finally treated in HEPA\n1  \nfi lters. Depending on the design of the cabinet, the air is \nrecycled inside the laboratory or extracted and renewed in diverse proportions. The air fl  ow, which in Class II cabinets \nmoves from the fi  lter towards the work surface, is laminar. A \nsummary of the existing type of cabinets and their principal characteristics is presented next. 1 HEPA: High Effi   ciency Particulate Air.

The microplate washer performs the washing of the ELISA plate\u2019s wells during the diff  erent stages of the technique. PHOTOGRAPH OF MICROPLATE WASHER \nPURPOSE OF THE MICROPLATE WASHER \nThe microplate washer has been designed to supply cleaning \nbuff ers required for the ELISA technique in a controlled \nmanner. In the same fashion, the equipment removes from each well, substances in excess from the reaction. Depending on the test performed, the washer can intervene from one to four times, supplying the washing buff  er, agitating and \nremoving the unbound reagents\n1 until the programmed \ntimes and cycles are completed. The washer has of two reservoirs; one for the washing buff  er, the other for the waste \ngenerated during the washing process.OPERATION PRINCIPLES \nThe microplate washer has been designed to perform washing operations in the ELISA t echnique. The equipment \npossesses at least, the following subsystems which vary depending on the manufacturer\u2019s design. \u2022\u2022 Control subsystem. Generally , the washer is controlled \nby microprocessors allowing programming and controlling steps to be performed by the washer such as: number of washing cycles\n2 (1\u20135); expected times; \nsupplying and extracting pressures; plate format (96\u2013384 wells); suction function adjustment according to the type of well\n3 (fl at bottom, V bottom or rounded \nbottom or strips used); volumes distributed or aspirated; the soaking and agitation cycles, etc. \u2022\u2022 Supply subsystem. In general, this comprises a reservoir \nfor the washing solution; one or several pumps; usually a positive displacement type syringe and a dispenser head that supplies the washing solution to the diff  erent \nwells by means of needles. The head usually comes with eight pairs of needles for washing and aspirating simultaneously the wells of the same row (the supply and extraction sub-systems converge on the head). There are models with twelve pairs of needles and others that conduct the washing process simultaneously in all the wells. Some washers off  er the possibility of working \nwith diff  erent types of washing solutions, performing \nthe solution changes according to the program entered by the operator. 1 See a brief explication of the ELISA technique in Chapter 1, Microplate \nReader . 2 The exact number of washing operations required depends on the assay \nused.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Verify the state of gaskets and watertight joints.

This enables the meter to read the pH of the calibration solution. For example: For a solution at pH = 7, the needle can oscillate slightly in units of 0.1 pH; on average, the reading should be 7. The reading of the meter (reading scale) should be done perpendicularly, to avoid or eliminate parallel-type errors (reading errors produced by the shadow of the meter\u2019s needle, visible on the mirror of the reading scale). The pH meter is then ready (calibrated), to carry out the correct pH readings.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>5. All biologically contaminated ducts have a negative \npressure. 6.

The following is a general explanation of the components of a distiller and a description of how these function. 1. Vapour generator. Also known as the boiling tank, \nthis component is the container where the water to be distilled is stored. In general, it has a hydraulic connection which allows the water evaporated and distilled to be replenished. It is generally made of glass in small distillers or of stainless steel with copper, tin or titanium coverings in large capacity machines. It can have level, fl  ow and water quality feed controls, which \nprotect the distiller in case some irregularity in the water supply occurs. As a source of energy, it uses the water vapour coming from a boiler or vapour generator, or the thermal energy from electrical immersion resistors through direct conduction. These cause the water temperature to rise until, in normal conditions (atmospheric pressure equal to an atmosphere and gravity acceleration equal to 9.80665 m\/s\n2) water in the \nliquid phase is transformed into vapour at 100 \u00b0C. 2.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>This is explained in each manufacturer\u2019s test instruction manual. 3 If the bottom is fl  at, the suction needle is located very close to one of well\u2019s \nfaces; if it is rounded or V-shaped, the suction needle is centered.

This equipment, provided \nit is carefully used and calibrated, measures the acidity of an aqueous solution. pH meters are sometimes called pH analysers, pH monitors or potentiometers. PURPOSE OF THE EQUIPMENT\nThe pH meter is commonly used in any fi  eld of science \nrelated to aqueous solutions. It is used in areas such as agriculture, water treatment and purifi  cation, in industrial \nprocesses such as petrochemicals, paper manufacture, foods, pharmaceuticals, research and development, metal mechanics, etc. In the health laboratory, its applications are related to the control of culture mediums and to the measurement of the alkalinity or acidity of broths and buff ers. In specialized laboratories, diagnostic equipment \nmicroelectrodes are used to measure the pH of liquid blood components. The plasma pH allows the patient\u2019s health to be evaluated. It normally measures between 7.35 and 7.45. This value relates to the patient\u2019s metabolism in which a multitude of reactions occurs where acids and bases are normally kept in balance. Acids constantly liberate hydrogen ions [H\n+] and the organism neutralizes or balances \nacidity by liberating bicarbonate ions [HCO3\u2013]. The acid-base \nratio in the organism is maintained by the kidneys, (organs in which any excesses present are eliminated). The plasma pH is one of the characteristics that vary with factors such as age or state of health of the patient.

A table which describes the main types of water baths is shown below. WATER BATH CONTROLS\nWater baths generally have very simple controls. Some manufacturers have incorporated controls with \nmicroprocessors. They vary depending on the type of bath. The diagram of a basic water bath\u2019s control panel is shown next. The control panel has these elements:\n1. The on and off   control switch\n2.

A pilot light6. Pilots (2) for identifying the temperature scale (\u00b0C, \u00b0F). WATER BATH OPERATION\nInstallation\n1. Install the water bath close to an electrical outlet. The \noutlet must ha ve its respective ground pole in order \nto guarantee the protection and safety of the operator and the equipment. Water baths generally operate at 120 V\/60 Hz or 230 V\/60Hz. Its installation and use is facilitated by a sink close by for supplying and draining of water. 2. Verify that the location selected is levelled and has the \nnecessary resistance to safely support the weight of the water bath when it is full of liquid. 3. Ensure that the location has a suitable amount of space \nfor putting the samples and the accessories required for the normal operation of the water bath. 4. Avoid placing the water bath where there are strong air \ncurrents which can interfere with its normal operation. For example: in front of an air-conditioning unit or window. Safety\n1. Avoid the use of the water bath in environments where \nther e are fl  ammable and combustible materials. The \nequipment has components (resistors generating very high temperatures) which could start an accidental fi  re \nor explosion. 2. Always connect the equipment to an electrical outlet \nwith a ground pole to protect the user and the equipment from electrical discharges. The electrical connection must comply with the required norms of the country and the laboratory. 3. Use the water bath exclusively with non-corrosive or \nnon-fl  ammable liquids. 4. Use personal protective elements when working with \nthe water bath. The bath has resistors which can cause burns if inadvertently touched, even a considerable time after turning off   the equipment. 5. When working with substances that generate vapours, \nplace the water bath under a chemical hood or in a well ventilated area. 6. Remember that liquids incubated in the water bath tank \ncan produce burns if hands are inadvertently placed inside it. 7. Take into account that the water bath is designed for \nuse with a liquid inside the tank. If the inside is dry, the temperature of the tank can become very high. Use the diff  using tray for placing the container inside of the \nfi lled tank of the water bath. This has been designed for \ndistributing the temperature in a uniform way. 8. Avoid using the water bath if any of its controls is not \nworking, e.g. the temperature or limit controls.Class Temperature range \nLow temperature  Room temperature up to 60 \u00b0C \nRoom temperature up to 100 \u00b0C\nHigh temperature Room temperature up to 275 \u00b0C.

A solution containing either a weak acid and its salt or, a weak base and its salt, which makes it resistant to changes in pH at a given temperature. PBS. One of the solutions used to perform washing operations in ELISA tests. PBS is the acronym for Phosphate Buff  er Solution. This  is made of the following \nsubstances: NaCl, KCl, NaHPO42H2O and KH2SO4. The manufacturers supply technical bulletins which indicate the proportions and instructions for preparing PBS. In \ngeneral, one part of concentrated PBS is mixed with 19 parts of deionised water. Plate (ELISA). Consumable with standard dimensions, designed to hold samples and reactions for the ELISA technique. In general, these have 96 , 384 or 1536 wells \nand are made of plastics such as polystyrene and polypropylene. There are plates specially treated to facilitate the performanc e of the tests. Positive displacement pump. A pump adjusted by a plunger moving along a cylinder. The mechanism is similar to that of a syringe. It is equipped with a set  of \nvalves for controlling the fl  ow to and from the pump. TMB\/H2O2.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Disadvantage: Does not protect the sample \nmanipulated in the cabinet.

Sterilization of the distilled water storage tank1 The minerals deposited on the cover of the immersion resistors are \nparticularly poor heat conductors in that they impede an effi   cient transfer \nof heat between the immersion resistance and the water in the distillation process. This makes the temperature of the resistance rise above that it would reach in normal operating conditions, deteriorating its condition and integrity.. CHAPTER 8  WATER DISTILLER\n56Frequency: Occasionally\nBefore operating a new water distiller, it is recommended to insure that the distilled water storage tank is sterile and clean. To carry out the sterilization, use a chemical process with domestic bleach (chlorine based), for example.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Allows work with small quantities of toxic and \nradioactive chemicals.

Protect the rotors\u2019 coating in order to avoid the metal \nbase from deteriorating. Do not use alkaline detergents or cleaning solutions which can remove the protective fi lm. The rotors generally made of aluminium [Al] are \ncovered by a fi  lm of anodized aluminium which protects \ntheir metal structure. 9. Use plastic brushes when cleaning the rotor. Metal \nbrushes scratch the protective coating and generate sources for future corrosion. Corrosion is accelerated in operation conditions and shortens the rotor\u2019s operational life. 10. If there are spills of corrosive substances, wash the rotor \nimmediately. 11. Air dry the rotor once cleaned and washed with water.12. Store vertical tube rotors and almost vertical tube rotors \nwith the larger side facing downwards and without their covers. 13. Store rotors in a dry area. Avoid leaving them in the \ncentrifuge. 14. Store swinging buckets rotors without the compartments\u2019 \ncovers. 15. Lubricate spiral and O-rings, according to the \nmanufacturer\u2019s recommendation. 16. Observe re commendations related to guaranteed times \nand operational life of each type of rotor. 17.

Load or unload rotors inside a biological safety cabinet \nif working with materials classifi  ed as Biosafety level II \nor higher. 20. Never try to open the cover of a centrifuge while it is \nfunctioning and never try to stop the rotor by hand. Tubes \nTube care includes aspects such as fi  lling of the tubes, adequat e temperature selection, centrifugation speed \nlimitations, washing and sterilization. The principle recommendations are the following:1. Wash tubes, adaptors and other accessories by hand \nusing a 1:10 mild detergent solution in water and a soft textured brush (not metallic). Avoid using automatic dishwashers. 2. Avoid using alcohol and acetone since such liquids aff  ect \nthe structure of the tubes. Manufacturers recommend the solvent to be used with each type of centrifugation tube material. 3. Avoid drying tubes in a drying oven. Dry always with a \nstream of hot air.4. Verify if the tubes are reusable or not. If they are \ndisposable, use them only once. 5. For sterilizing, it is necessary to verify the material from \nwhich the tube is made, as not all can stand sterilization by heat. Glass tubes are normally sterilized with vapour at 121 \u00b0C for 30 minutes. 6. Store tubes and bottles in a dark, fresh, dry place, \nfar from chemical vapours or ultraviolet radiation sources. 7. Verify maximum fi  lling levels and the sealing of thin \nwall tubes in order to avoid collapse inside the rotor by the action of the centrifugal force. Comply with manufacturers recommendations. Preventive maintenance\nWarning:  Nev er carry out a technical intervention in a \ncentrifuge if it has not been previously decontaminated. The most important maintenance routines performed on a \ncentrifuge are the following:Frequency: Monthly1. Verify that the centrifuge external components are free \nof dust and stains. Avoid aff  ecting the rotor with spills. Clean the rotor compartment using a mild detergent. 2. Test that the rotors\u2019 connecting and adjustment \nmechanisms are in good condition. Keep the points lubricated as the manufacturer recommends. 3. Verify the locking \/safety mechanism of the centrifuge\u2019s \ncover. This is fundamental in guaranteeing operators\u2019 safety as this mechanism keeps the cover of the centrifuge closed while the rotor is turning. 4.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>5.

The manual also aims to provide support to personnel responsible for technical management, implementation of quality management and maintenance. Due to the diversity of origins, brands and models, this manual off  ers general recommendations. Equipment-specifi  c details \nare explained in depth in the maintenance and installation user manuals from manufacturers. These should be requested and ordered through the procurement processes of the individual agencies and professionals responsible for the acquisition of technology, or directly from the manufacturer. This manual was originally developed by the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) to support improved quality \nprogrammes which PAHO promotes in regional laboratories. The English version was produced by WHO to further expand support for quality programmes in other regions. The revised edition now includes 20 equipment groups selected to cover those most commonly used in low to medium technical complexity laboratories across the world. Given the diff  erences in \ntechnical complexity, brands and existing models, each chapter has been developed with basic equipment in mind, including new technology where relevant. The following information is included in each chapter: \n\u2022\u2022 Groups of equipment, organized by their generic names. Alternative names have also been included. \u2022\u2022 Photographs or diagrams, or a combination of both t o identify the type of equipment under consideration. \u2022\u2022 A brief explanation on the main uses or applications of the equipment in the laboratory. \u2022\u2022 A basic description of the principles by which the equipment operates with explanations of principles or physical and\/or \nchemical la ws which the interested reader can \u2013 or should study in depth. \u2022\u2022 Installation requirements with emphasis on the electrical aspects and the r equirements for safe installation and operation, \nincluding worldwide electrical standards. \u2022\u2022 Basic routine maintenance, classifi  ed according to the required frequency (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually \nor sporadically). The procedures are numbered and presented in the actual sequence in which these should take place (model-specifi  c procedures can be found in the manuals published by the manufacturers). \u2022\u2022 Troubleshooting tables with the most frequent problems aff  ecting the equipment with possible causes and actions that \nmay resolve these problems. \u2022\u2022 A list of basic defi  nitions of some of the specialized terms used.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Check the lamp\u2019s wire.

Cleaning is done b y using a piece of clean cloth which \nmay be dampened with distilled water. If there is a stain, a mild detergent can be applied. Also a paintbrush with soft bristles can be used to remove particles or dust deposited on the weight plate. 2. Clean the weighing chamber, externally and internally. Verify that the glass is free from dust. 3. Verify that the adjustment mechanisms on the front \ndoor of the weighing chamber works adequately.4. Always use a clean, pre-weighed container for weighing \n(glass container or weighing paper if possible). Note that plastic can become electromagnetically charged and is not recommended for weighing powdered or granulated chemicals. 5.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Specifi  es the type of rotor for which the \ntechnical information is being provided. 2.

The water distiller, also called distillation unit or water still, used in the laboratory, purifi  es running water by means of controlled \nvaporization and cooling processes. Upon applying thermal energy to water in a liquid phase by a warming process, it is changed into vapour. This allows the water molecules to separate from the molecules of other substances mixed or diluted. The water vapour is collected and passed through a condenser, where it is cooled and returned to the liquid phase. Then, the condensed water is collected into a diff  erent storage tank. Distilled water shows pure \ncharacteristics compared to running water; it is practically free of contaminating substances.PURPOSE OF THE WATER DISTILLER\nThe water distiller facilitates obtaining very pure water from potable wat er normally provided by the aqueduct services \nin urban centres. Distilled water is characterized by a lack of solids in suspension. It is used in multiple applications in centres which provide health services, especially in laboratory units, in washing, sterilization and dietetics. The more specialized the procedures are in the laboratory, the greater will be the level of purity required. For example: the preparation of reagents or biological material requires water of the highest quality. Distillation is one of the fundamental processes to achieve this (although it may not be the only one required). Water used in laboratories must be free of pyrogens, with a concentration of total solids no greater than 1 ppm, a pH value between 5.4 and 7.2 and an electrical resistance of at least 3 x 10\n5 ohm\/cm at 25 \u00b0C1. 1 Warming cabinets, sterilizers, and associated equipment , Division 11\u2013 \nEquipment, USACE\/NAVFAC\/ AFCESA, UFGS-11710, July 2003.

If it is necessary to measure the pH of more than one solution, repeat the previously described procedures, rinsing the probe with distilled water and drying with clean, lint-free paper between readings.

Its purpose is to give a better \nunderstanding of the technical requirements regarding installation, use and maintenance of various types of equipment which play an important role in performing diagnostic testing. The manual also aims to provide support to personnel responsible for technical management, implementation of quality management and maintenance. Due to the diversity of origins, brands and models, this manual off  ers general recommendations. Equipment-specifi  c details \nare explained in depth in the maintenance and installation user manuals from manufacturers. These should be requested and ordered through the procurement processes of the individual agencies and professionals responsible for the acquisition of technology, or directly from the manufacturer. This manual was originally developed by the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) to support improved quality \nprogrammes which PAHO promotes in regional laboratories. The English version was produced by WHO to further expand support for quality programmes in other regions. The revised edition now includes 20 equipment groups selected to cover those most commonly used in low to medium technical complexity laboratories across the world. Given the diff  erences in \ntechnical complexity, brands and existing models, each chapter has been developed with basic equipment in mind, including new technology where relevant. The following information is included in each chapter: \n\u2022\u2022 Groups of equipment, organized by their generic names. Alternative names have also been included. \u2022\u2022 Photographs or diagrams, or a combination of both t o identify the type of equipment under consideration. \u2022\u2022 A brief explanation on the main uses or applications of the equipment in the laboratory. \u2022\u2022 A basic description of the principles by which the equipment operates with explanations of principles or physical and\/or \nchemical la ws which the interested reader can \u2013 or should study in depth. \u2022\u2022 Installation requirements with emphasis on the electrical aspects and the r equirements for safe installation and operation, \nincluding worldwide electrical standards. \u2022\u2022 Basic routine maintenance, classifi  ed according to the required frequency (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually \nor sporadically).

The diff  erence in the results when the load in the balance is increased or decreased. Lateral load. A balance\u2019s ability to consistently read the value of masses, no matter where they are placed on the weighing scale. This is a lso called corner load. Lateral load error. A deviation in the results when an object is weighed placing it in diff  erent parts of the weighing plate, i.e. in the centre o f the plate and on \none of its sides. Linear error. A diff  erence showed when the balance is loaded in a successive manner, increasing the quantity of weight in equal magnitude un til it reaches its \nmaximum capacity and unloaded in an analogous process. The diff  erences shown between the readings obtained and the arithmetic v alues corresponding to the \nweights used are interpreted as non-linearity. Linearity. Refers to the ability of a balance to perform  accurate readings of weights throughout its weighing capacity . A graph showing  weight compared to the \nweight indication on a perfectly linear balance should generate a straight line. In order to determine the linear error of a ba lance, certifi  ed masses must be used. The procedure allows the linear diff  erences to be calculated by reading certifi  ed masses with and without preloading. The diff  e rence between the readings allows \nthe linear error to be calculated. Mass. A physical property of the bodies related to the quantity of matter, expressed in kilograms (kg), these contain. In physics, t here are two quantities to which \nthe name mass is given: gravitational mass  which is a measure of the way a body interacts with the gravitational fi  eld (if the body\u2019s mass is small, the body \nexperiences a weaker force than if its mass were greater) and the inertial mass , which is a quantitative or numerical measure of a body\u2019s inertia, that is, of its \nresistance to acceleration. The unit for expressing mass is the kilogram [kg]. OIML.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>2. Clean the detectors\u2019 optical systems and the lighting \nsystems. 3.

This information, along with good use and care, helps to maintain laboratory equipment in optimal condition.MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n1The microplate reader also known as \u201cPhotometric \nmicro-plate reader or ELISA reader\u201d is a specialized spectrophotometer designed to read results of the ELISA test, a technique used to determine the presence of antibodies or specifi  c antigens in samples. The technique \nis based on the detection of an antigen or antibodies captured on a solid surface using direct or secondary, labelled antibodies, producing a reaction whose product can be read by the spectrophotometer. The word ELISA is the acronym for \u201cEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay\u201d . This chapter covers the use of microplate readers for ELISA testing. For additional information on the instrument principles of operation and maintenance, consult Chapter 11 discussing the spectrophotometer. PHOTOGRAPH OF MICROPLATE READER\nPURPOSE OF THE MICROPLATE READER\nThe microplate reader is used for reading the results of ELISA \ntests. This technique has a direct application in immunology and serology. Among other applications it confi  rms the \npresence of antibodies or antigens of an infectious agent in an organism, antibodies from a vaccine or auto-antibodies, for example in rheumatoid arthritis.OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThe microplate reader is a specialized spectrophotometer. Unlike the c onventional spectrophotometer which facilitates \nreadings on a wide range of wavelengths, the microplate reader has filters or diffraction gratings that limit the wavelength range to that used in ELISA, generally between 400 to 750 nm (nanometres). Some readers operate in the ultraviolet range and carry out analyses between 340 to 700 nm. The optical system exploited by many manufacturers uses optic fi  bres to supply light to the microplate wells \ncontaining the samples. The light beam, passing through the sample has a diameter ranging between 1 to 3 mm. A detection system detects the light coming from the sample, amplifi  es the signal and determines the sample\u2019s \nabsorbance. A reading system converts it into data allowing the test result interpretation. Some microplate readers use double beam light systems. Test samples are located in specially designed plates with \na specifi  c number of wells where the procedure or test is \ncarried out. Plates of 8 columns by 12 rows with a total of 96 wells are common. There are also plates with a greater number of wells. For specialized applications, the current trend is to increase the number of wells (384-well plates) to reduce the amount of reagents and samples used and a greater throughput. The location of the optical sensors of the microplate reader varies depending on the manufacturers: these can be located above the sample plate, or directly underneath the plate\u2019s wells. Nowadays microplate readers have controls regulated by \nmicroprocessors; connection interfaces to information systems; quality and process control programs, which by means of a computer, allow complete test automation.Chapter 1\nMicroplate Reader\nGMDN Code 37036\nECRI Code 16-979\nDenomination Photometric micro-plate reader\nPhoto courtesy of BioRad Laboratories CHAPTER 1  MICROPLATE READER\n2Equipment required for ELISA testing\nIn order to perform the ELISA technique, the following \nequipment is r equired:  \n1. Microplate reader.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Repair\/cleaning of the fl  ow regulator valves, bell type \nadjustment fi  ttings. Cabinet certi\ufb01  cation\nThe certifi  cation process of the biological safety cabinets \nis regulated by Standard NSF 49, which applies to all Class II cabinets. This defines materials, design criteria and construction, operation parameters and tests which allow the cabinet to be guaranteed as safe and suitable for the work performed. The following is a list of tests, in which standards mentioned are included.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Information on the compatibility of the rotor with other \nmodels of centrifuges from the same manufacturer. Recently manufactured centrifuges have incorporated \nnumerous improvements into their design to provide greater safety and longer operational life. Among advances mentioned are controls based on microprocessors. By means of software  controlled by a keyboard, these have several \ndiff erent operational programs in memory. According to the \ntype of rotor being used and procedure conducted, these programs control the centrifugation time, the required temperature, the rotor\u2019s revolutions, the acceleration and deceleration, alarms warning the operator about any anomaly during operation. Manufacturers have also incorporated induction motors \n(without brushes) in centrifuges. These have the advantage of electronically controlling currents and magnetic fields regulating the rotor\u2019s speed which reduces the frequency of maintenance. Operation and maintenance of such equipment must be carried out according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS\nCentrifuges require the following for normal operation:1. An electrical connection with a capacity suitable for the \nequipment providing stable single phase or triphase type voltage (depending on the model and specifi  cation \ngiven by the manufacturer). In general, centrifuges use 110V or 220 V\/60 Hz. 2.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Remove the tubes and syringes.3. Store the syringes in their original protective covers.4.

Its purpose is to give a better \nunderstanding of the technical requirements regarding installation, use and maintenance of various types of equipment which play an important role in performing diagnostic testing. The manual also aims to provide support to personnel responsible for technical management, implementation of quality management and maintenance. Due to the diversity of origins, brands and models, this manual off  ers general recommendations. Equipment-specifi  c details \nare explained in depth in the maintenance and installation user manuals from manufacturers. These should be requested and ordered through the procurement processes of the individual agencies and professionals responsible for the acquisition of technology, or directly from the manufacturer. This manual was originally developed by the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) to support improved quality \nprogrammes which PAHO promotes in regional laboratories. The English version was produced by WHO to further expand support for quality programmes in other regions. The revised edition now includes 20 equipment groups selected to cover those most commonly used in low to medium technical complexity laboratories across the world. Given the diff  erences in \ntechnical complexity, brands and existing models, each chapter has been developed with basic equipment in mind, including new technology where relevant.

Turn the functions selector from Standby position to \npH position. 3.1 T his action connects the electrode to the pH \nmeasuring scale in the pH meter. 3.2 Adjust the meter to read the pH of the calibration \nsolution using the button marked Cal 1. This enables the meter to read the pH of the calibration solution. For example: For a solution at pH = 7, the needle can oscillate slightly in units of 0.1 pH; on average, the reading should be 7. The reading of the meter (reading scale) should be done perpendicularly, to avoid or eliminate parallel-type errors (reading errors produced by the shadow of the meter\u2019s needle, visible on the mirror of the reading scale). The pH meter is then ready (calibrated), to carry out the correct pH readings.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Design and Layout: L\u2019IV Com S\u00e0rl, Morges SwitzerlandPrinted in SpainContact:\nDr G.

OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nWater baths are made of steel and are generally c overed with electrostatic paint \nwith high adherence and resistance to environmental laboratory conditions. Water baths have an external panel on which the controls can be found. They also have a tank made of rustproof material with a collection of electrical resistors mounted on their lower part. By means of these, heat is transferred to the medium (water or oil) until reaching the temperature selected with a control device (thermostat or similar). The resistors may be of the following types:\u2022 Immersion type. These resistors are installed inside \na sealed tube and located on the lower part of the container in direct contact with heating medium. \u2022\u2022 External. These resistors are located on the lower part \nbut on the outside of the tank. These are protected by an isolating material which prevents heat loss. This type of resistor transfers the heat to the bottom of the tank through thermal conduction. The water bath is an instrument used in the laboratory for\n \u2022\n\u2022\nImmersion type.

A table which describes the main types of water baths is shown below. WATER BATH CONTROLS\nWater baths generally have very simple controls. Some manufacturers have incorporated controls with \nmicroprocessors. They vary depending on the type of bath. The diagram of a basic water bath\u2019s control panel is shown next. The control panel has these elements:\n1. The on and off   control switch\n2. A Menu button for selecting the operation\u2019s parameters: \noperation temperature, alarm temperature, temperature scale (\u00b0C, \u00b0F)\n3. Two buttons for parameter adjustment4. A screen 5. A pilot light6. Pilots (2) for identifying the temperature scale (\u00b0C, \u00b0F). WATER BATH OPERATION\nInstallation\n1. Install the water bath close to an electrical outlet. The \noutlet must ha ve its respective ground pole in order \nto guarantee the protection and safety of the operator and the equipment. Water baths generally operate at 120 V\/60 Hz or 230 V\/60Hz. Its installation and use is facilitated by a sink close by for supplying and draining of water. 2. Verify that the location selected is levelled and has the \nnecessary resistance to safely support the weight of the water bath when it is full of liquid. 3. Ensure that the location has a suitable amount of space \nfor putting the samples and the accessories required for the normal operation of the water bath. 4. Avoid placing the water bath where there are strong air \ncurrents which can interfere with its normal operation. For example: in front of an air-conditioning unit or window. Safety\n1. Avoid the use of the water bath in environments where \nther e are fl  ammable and combustible materials. The \nequipment has components (resistors generating very high temperatures) which could start an accidental fi  re \nor explosion. 2. Always connect the equipment to an electrical outlet \nwith a ground pole to protect the user and the equipment from electrical discharges. The electrical connection must comply with the required norms of the country and the laboratory. 3. Use the water bath exclusively with non-corrosive or \nnon-fl  ammable liquids. 4. Use personal protective elements when working with \nthe water bath. The bath has resistors which can cause burns if inadvertently touched, even a considerable time after turning off   the equipment. 5. When working with substances that generate vapours, \nplace the water bath under a chemical hood or in a well ventilated area. 6. Remember that liquids incubated in the water bath tank \ncan produce burns if hands are inadvertently placed inside it. 7. Take into account that the water bath is designed for \nuse with a liquid inside the tank. If the inside is dry, the temperature of the tank can become very high. Use the diff  using tray for placing the container inside of the \nfi lled tank of the water bath. This has been designed for \ndistributing the temperature in a uniform way. 8. Avoid using the water bath if any of its controls is not \nworking, e.g. the temperature or limit controls.Class Temperature range \nLow temperature  Room temperature up to 60 \u00b0C \nRoom temperature up to 100 \u00b0C\nHigh temperature Room temperature up to 275 \u00b0C.

Maintenance\nWarning : Bef ore carrying out any maintenance activity, \ndisconnect the equipment from the electrical feed outlet. Water baths are equipment whose maintenance is simple. The recommended routines mainly focus on the cleaning of external components. The most common routines are featured next. Cleaning\nFrequency: Monthly1. T urn off   and disconnect the equipment. Wait until it \ncools to avoid the risk of burns and accidents. 2. Remove the fl  uid used for heating. If it is water, it can \nbe poured through a siphon. If it is oil; collect into a container with an adequate capacity. 3. Remove the thermal diff  usion grid located at the bottom \nof the tank. 4. Disassemble the circulator and clean to remove scale \nand potential algae present. 5.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>A clean, dust free environment with a fi  rm levelled \nfl oor. 3.

ROUTINE MAINTENANCE\nThe routine maintenance required by a centrifuge depends on multiple fac tors such as the incorporated technology, \nusage intensity, training of users, quality of the electrical feed and environmental conditions. The following are general recommendations regarding adequate use and most common maintenance for guaranteeing correct operation. The routines or specialized repairs will depend on manufacturers\u2019 recommendations for each brand and model. Always disinfect the rotor bowl, centrifuge head, buckets and trunnion rings as applicable before any servicing of centrifuges used to prepare clinical or infectious samples. Priority recommendation. Verify that only qualifi  ed personnel \ntrained and familiar with the use, care, risks and handling of the centrifuge operates it. It is the laboratory directors\u2019 responsibility to supervise and take necessary precautions so that personnel operating centrifuges understand the implications of working with such equipment. APPROPRIATE MANAGEMENT AND STORAGE RECOMMEND ATIONS\n1\nRotors\n1. Register the date of purchase of each one of the rotors, \nincluding inf ormation related to the serial and model \nnumber. 2. Read and understand the rotor manuals, equipment \nand tubes before use. Comply with indications for use and care specifi  ed by the manufacturer. 3. Use rotors only in centrifuges for which these have \nbeen manufactured. Do not interchange rotors without verifying the compatibility with the centrifuge. 4. Register operation parameters for each rotor in a log \nbook in order to determine its remaining operational life and to acquire its replacements when needed. 5. Use the recommendations regarding maximum speed \nand sample density from the manufacturer. Each rotor is designed for supporting a maximum level of eff  ort; \nthese specifi  cations must be followed rigorously. 1 http:\/\/www.sunysb.edu\/facilities\/ehs\/lab\/cs.shtmlk=lnrmaxrmin ()\n\u03c92\u00d71013\n3600MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n49\n6.

Extraction is done by a set of needles mounted on the washer\/dryer\u2019s head. The number of needles varies from one to three, according to the washer model used. If it uses only one needle, the washing and \nextraction operation is done with this single needle. If it uses two needles, one is used for supplying the washing solution and the other for extraction. If it uses three needles, the fi  rst is used for supplying the washing \nsolution, the second for extraction and the third for controlling (extracting) any excess volume in the well. Generally, the extraction needle is longer than the supply needle, which enables it to advance (vertically) up to a height ranging between 0.3 and 0.5 mm from the bottom of the well. \u2022\u2022 Advance sub-system. This is composed of a \nmechanism which moves the supply and extraction head horizontally to reach each well in the ELISA plate. When the horizontal movement to the following row occurs, there is a vertical movement towards the well to dispense or extract the washing solution. There are washers which carry out these operations in a simultaneous manner.The sub-systems previously described are shown in Figure \n2. Figure 3 shows the diff  erent types of wells most commonly \nfound in microplates. Each kind of well is suitable for a particular type of test. Washing process\nThe washing of the microplate is one of the stages of the ELISA t echnique. Special solutions are used in the washing \nsteps. Among those most commonly used is phosphate buff er solution or PBS. The phosphate buff  er solution has a \nstability of 2 months if kept at 4 \u00b0C. It is estimated that 1 to 3 litres of solution is required for washing one microplate and that 300 \u00b5l is used in each well per cycle. Washing can \nbe done manually, but it is preferable to use an automated microplate washer for a better throughput and to minimize handling of potentially contaminated substances. Among the washing processes used by microplate washers \nare featured:\n\u2022\u2022 Aspir ation from top to bottom. When the aspiration \nphase is initiated, the needles move vertically and the aspiration is initiated immediately as these enter into the liquid. The process continues until the needles reach their lowest position very close to the bottom of the wells. At this point they are stopped in order to avoid suctioning the air that should fl  ow against the \ninterior lateral walls of the wells. This type of aspiration prevents air currents from drying the bound protein on the surface of the wells.

The horizontal and vertical position adjustment with respect to the wells must be verifi  ed carefully. If the \nplate has fl  at bottom wells, the supply needle must be \nchecked to see that it is situated very close to the well\u2019s wall. If the bottom is round or V-shaped, the suction needle should be located in the centre of the well: upon the vertical movement, a needle-base distance is maintained in the well, usually between 0.3 to 0.5 mm. The needles must never be allowed to touch the bottom of the wells to avoid mechanical interferences between the needle point and the well\u2019s base during the aspiration function. \u2022\u2022 Aspir ation time. Appropriately adjust the aspiration \ntime so that a solution fi  lm adhered to the well\u2019s wall \ncan fl  ow towards the bottom. Avoid very long time lapses to prevent the coating on the wells from drying up. Check that the suction system\u2019s needles are clean (free of obstructions). \u2022\u2022 Distributed V olume. Check that the volume distributed \nis as close as possible to the maximum capacity of the well; confi  rm that all the wells are fi  lled uniformly (at \nthe same level). Verify that the distributing needles are clean (free of obstructions). \u2022\u2022 Vacuum. The suctioning system must be calibrated \neffi  ciently. If the vacuum is too strong, the test can \nbe altered. In fact, it could dry out the wells and considerably weaken the enzyme activity in the wells and completely alter the test result. The majority of washers function with a vacuum ranging between 60 and 70% of atmospheric pressure. In some washers, the vacuum is made in an external pump which operates as an accessory of the washer. Its operation is controlled by the washer, which means that the vacuum pump operates only when required. Washing process veri\ufb01  cation \nTo verify that the washing process is done according to \nthe specifications of ELISA t echniques, manufacturers \nof ELISA tests have developed procedures to be carried out regularly. One of the controls\n1 is based on using the \nperoxidase reagent, which is dispensed using a pipette in the plate wells to be read at 405, 450 and 492 nm. At once the wells are washed and a colourless substrate is added (TMB\/H\n2O2\u2013Tetramethylbenzidine\/Hydrogen Peroxide). Whatever conjugate remains will hydrolyze the enzyme and the chromogen will change to blue. After stopping the reaction with acid, the TMB will turn yellow again.

A clean, dust-free environment.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>The balance has other names \nsuch as scale and weight. It must be taken into account that the weight is the force which the gravitational fi  eld exercises on a body\u2019s mass, this force being the product of the mass \nby the local acceleration of gravity [F = m x g]. The term local is used to emphasize that this acceleration depends on factors such as the geographical latitude, altitude and the Earth\u2019s density where the measurement is taken. This force is measured in Newtons.

In the laboratory, the balance is used \nfor weighing as part of quality control activities (on devices like pipettes), in the preparation of mixtures of components in predefined proportions and in the determination of specifi  c densities or weights. OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThere are diff  erences in design, principles and criteria of \nmetrology amongst balances. At present, there are two large groups of balances: mechanical and electronic balances. Mechanical balances \nThe following are some of the more common ones: 1. Spring balance. Its function is based on a mechanical \nproperty of springs as the force exercised on a spring is proportional to the spring\u2019s elasticity constant [k], multiplied by its elongation [x] [F = -kx]. The greater the mass [m] placed on the balance\u2019s plate, the greater the elongation will be, given that the elongation is proportional to the mass and the spring\u2019s constant. The calibration of a spring balance depends on the force of gravity acting on the object weighed. This type of balance is used when great precision is not necessary. 2. Sliding weight balance. This type of balance is \nequipped with two known weights which can be moved on setting scales (one macro, the other micro). Upon placing a substance of unknown mass on the tray, its weight is determined by moving the weight on both setting scales until the equilibrium position is reached. At this point, the weight is obtained by adding both quantities indicated by the sliding masses\u2019 position on the scale. 3. Analytical balance. This balance functions by comparing \nknown weight masses with that of a substance of unknown weight. It is composed of a base on a bar or symmetrical lever, maintained by a blade-like support on a central point called a fulcrum. At its ends, there are stirrups, also supported with blades which allow these to oscillate smoothly. From there, two plates are suspended. Certifi  ed weights are placed on one \nof the plates and unknown weights on the other. The balance has a securing system or lock, which allows the main lever to remain stable when not in use or when it is necessary to modify the counter-weights. The balance is inside an external box which protects it from interferences, such as air currents. Analytical balances can weigh ten thousandths of a gram (0.0001 g) or 100 thousandths of a gram (0.00001 g). This type of balance generally has a capacity of up to 200 grams.

Analytical balance  MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n23It is necessary to have a set of certifi  ed masses. The set is \ngenerally composed of the following pieces:\n4. Upper plate balance (Top loading or parallel guidance \nbalance). This type of balance has a loading plate located \non its upper part, supported by a column maintained in a vertical position by two pairs of guides with fl  exible \nconnections. The eff  ect of the force produced by the \nmass is transmitted from a point on the vertical column directly or by some mechanical means to the loading cell. The requirement with this type of mechanism is that parallel guides must be maintained with exactitude of up to \u00b1 1  \u00b5m. Deviations in parallelism cause an error known \nas lateral load (when the mass being weighed shows diff erences if the reading is taken at the centre of the \nplate or on one of its sides). The diagram shown below explains the operation principle some manufacturers have introduced in electronic balances.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>a thermometer and an agitation unit to keep the temperature constant (not shown). OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nWater baths are made of steel and are generally c overed with electrostatic paint \nwith high adherence and resistance to environmental laboratory conditions. Water baths have an external panel on which the controls can be found. They also have a tank made of rustproof material with a collection of electrical resistors mounted on their lower part. By means of these, heat is transferred to the medium (water or oil) until reaching the temperature selected with a control device (thermostat or similar). The resistors may be of the following types:\u2022 Immersion type.

A table which describes the main types of water baths is shown below. WATER BATH CONTROLS\nWater baths generally have very simple controls. Some manufacturers have incorporated controls with \nmicroprocessors. They vary depending on the type of bath. The diagram of a basic water bath\u2019s control panel is shown next. The control panel has these elements:\n1. The on and off   control switch\n2.

A pilot light6. Pilots (2) for identifying the temperature scale (\u00b0C, \u00b0F). WATER BATH OPERATION\nInstallation\n1. Install the water bath close to an electrical outlet. The \noutlet must ha ve its respective ground pole in order \nto guarantee the protection and safety of the operator and the equipment. Water baths generally operate at 120 V\/60 Hz or 230 V\/60Hz. Its installation and use is facilitated by a sink close by for supplying and draining of water. 2. Verify that the location selected is levelled and has the \nnecessary resistance to safely support the weight of the water bath when it is full of liquid. 3. Ensure that the location has a suitable amount of space \nfor putting the samples and the accessories required for the normal operation of the water bath. 4. Avoid placing the water bath where there are strong air \ncurrents which can interfere with its normal operation. For example: in front of an air-conditioning unit or window. Safety\n1. Avoid the use of the water bath in environments where \nther e are fl  ammable and combustible materials. The \nequipment has components (resistors generating very high temperatures) which could start an accidental fi  re \nor explosion. 2. Always connect the equipment to an electrical outlet \nwith a ground pole to protect the user and the equipment from electrical discharges. The electrical connection must comply with the required norms of the country and the laboratory. 3. Use the water bath exclusively with non-corrosive or \nnon-fl  ammable liquids. 4. Use personal protective elements when working with \nthe water bath.

Extraction is done by a set of needles mounted on the washer\/dryer\u2019s head. The number of needles varies from one to three, according to the washer model used. If it uses only one needle, the washing and \nextraction operation is done with this single needle. If it uses two needles, one is used for supplying the washing solution and the other for extraction. If it uses three needles, the fi  rst is used for supplying the washing \nsolution, the second for extraction and the third for controlling (extracting) any excess volume in the well. Generally, the extraction needle is longer than the supply needle, which enables it to advance (vertically) up to a height ranging between 0.3 and 0.5 mm from the bottom of the well. \u2022\u2022 Advance sub-system. This is composed of a \nmechanism which moves the supply and extraction head horizontally to reach each well in the ELISA plate. When the horizontal movement to the following row occurs, there is a vertical movement towards the well to dispense or extract the washing solution. There are washers which carry out these operations in a simultaneous manner.The sub-systems previously described are shown in Figure \n2. Figure 3 shows the diff  erent types of wells most commonly \nfound in microplates. Each kind of well is suitable for a particular type of test. Washing process\nThe washing of the microplate is one of the stages of the ELISA t echnique. Special solutions are used in the washing \nsteps. Among those most commonly used is phosphate buff er solution or PBS. The phosphate buff  er solution has a \nstability of 2 months if kept at 4 \u00b0C. It is estimated that 1 to 3 litres of solution is required for washing one microplate and that 300 \u00b5l is used in each well per cycle. Washing can \nbe done manually, but it is preferable to use an automated microplate washer for a better throughput and to minimize handling of potentially contaminated substances. Among the washing processes used by microplate washers \nare featured:\n\u2022\u2022 Aspir ation from top to bottom. When the aspiration \nphase is initiated, the needles move vertically and the aspiration is initiated immediately as these enter into the liquid. The process continues until the needles reach their lowest position very close to the bottom of the wells. At this point they are stopped in order to avoid suctioning the air that should fl  ow against the \ninterior lateral walls of the wells. This type of aspiration prevents air currents from drying the bound protein on the surface of the wells.

In this system, \nthe aspiration of the fluid contained in the wells is performed initially with the aspiration needles in a position very close to the bottom, immediately beginning a suctioning cycle, usually time-controlled. This system may aspirate air if there are diff  erences in \nthe levels of the tanks. Washer calibration\nThe microplate washer is critical for guaranteeing that the ELISA t echnique performs as expected. The alignment to \nbe taken into account for the eff  ective functioning of the \nequipment is presented next:\n\u2022\u2022 Position of the needles (supply and aspiration head). The horizontal and vertical position adjustment with respect to the wells must be verifi  ed carefully. If the \nplate has fl  at bottom wells, the supply needle must be \nchecked to see that it is situated very close to the well\u2019s wall. If the bottom is round or V-shaped, the suction needle should be located in the centre of the well: upon the vertical movement, a needle-base distance is maintained in the well, usually between 0.3 to 0.5 mm. The needles must never be allowed to touch the bottom of the wells to avoid mechanical interferences between the needle point and the well\u2019s base during the aspiration function. \u2022\u2022 Aspir ation time. Appropriately adjust the aspiration \ntime so that a solution fi  lm adhered to the well\u2019s wall \ncan fl  ow towards the bottom. Avoid very long time lapses to prevent the coating on the wells from drying up. Check that the suction system\u2019s needles are clean (free of obstructions). \u2022\u2022 Distributed V olume. Check that the volume distributed \nis as close as possible to the maximum capacity of the well; confi  rm that all the wells are fi  lled uniformly (at \nthe same level). Verify that the distributing needles are clean (free of obstructions). \u2022\u2022 Vacuum. The suctioning system must be calibrated \neffi  ciently. If the vacuum is too strong, the test can \nbe altered. In fact, it could dry out the wells and considerably weaken the enzyme activity in the wells and completely alter the test result. The majority of washers function with a vacuum ranging between 60 and 70% of atmospheric pressure. In some washers, the vacuum is made in an external pump which operates as an accessory of the washer. Its operation is controlled by the washer, which means that the vacuum pump operates only when required. Washing process veri\ufb01  cation \nTo verify that the washing process is done according to \nthe specifications of ELISA t echniques, manufacturers \nof ELISA tests have developed procedures to be carried out regularly. One of the controls\n1 is based on using the \nperoxidase reagent, which is dispensed using a pipette in the plate wells to be read at 405, 450 and 492 nm. At once the wells are washed and a colourless substrate is added (TMB\/H\n2O2\u2013Tetramethylbenzidine\/Hydrogen Peroxide). Whatever conjugate remains will hydrolyze the enzyme and the chromogen will change to blue. After stopping the reaction with acid, the TMB will turn yellow again.

The \ncentrifuge is designed to use the centrifugal force generated in rotational movements to separate the constitutive elements of a mixture. There is a wide range of centrifuges capable of serving specifi  c industry and research needs. This \nchapter focuses on standing centrifuges normally used in public health and clinical laboratories. PHOTOGRAPH OF CENTRIFUGEPURPOSE OF THE CENTRIFUGE\nThe centrifuge uses centrifugal force (the force generated \nwhen an objec t rotates around a single point), for separating \nsolids suspended in a liquid by sedimentation, or liquids of diverse density. The rotational movements allow forces much greater than gravity to be generated in controlled periods of time. In the laboratory, centrifuges are generally used in processes such as the separation of solid components from biological liquids through sedimentation and in particular of blood components: red cells, white cells, platelets among others and for conducting multiple tests and treatments.There are several kinds of centrifuges. The most widely used in public health, surveillance and clinical laboratories are the table-top centrifuge, the ultracentrifuge, the haeamatocrit centrifuge and the standing centrifuge. OPERATION PRINCIPLES \nCentrifuges represent a practical application of Newton\u2019s law of motion. When a body of mass [m] turns around \na central point [O], it is subjected to a centripetal  force \n[N] directed towards the rotation axis with a magnitude N = m\u03c9\n2R, where [m] is the mass of the body, [R] is the radius \nand \u03c9 is the angular speed. Centrifuges possess a rotating axis on which is mounted a rotor with sample receiving compartments. Tangential speed is defi  ned by the following \nequation: VT=\u03c9R. Photo courtesy of Beckman CoulterCHAPTER 7  CENTRIFUGE\n46When the system spins at a speed of \u03c9 radians per second, \nthe samples are subjected to the centrifugal force Fp of the \nsame magnitude as N, but in an opposite direction. The \nfi gure shown below1 features a diagram of the concept, \nof its actual application and of the obtained result. This Fp force acts on particles in the substance centrifuged, \ncausing them to separate as a result of diff  erences in density. Denser particles will settle at the bottom of the tube in shorter periods of time, while lighter ones require longer periods of time, settling onto those of greater density. The relationship between the centrifugal acceleration [\u03c9\n2r ] to a \ngiven radius [r] and the force of gravity [g] is known as the relative centrifugal fi  eld or [RCF]\n2. RCF =r\u03c92\ng\nThe RCF is the tool which allows rotors of different \nspecifi  cations to be compared when equivalent centrifugal \neff ects are required. COMPONENTS OF THE CENTRIFUGE \nThe most important components of a centrifuge are the \nfollowing3:\nThe electric\/electronic control which generally has the following elements:1. On and off control, operation time control (timer), \nrotation speed control (in some centrifuges), temperature control (in refrigerated centrifuges), vibration control (safety mechanism) and brake system.2. Refrigeration system (in refrigerated centrifuges). 3.

Appropriately adjust the aspiration \ntime so that a solution fi  lm adhered to the well\u2019s wall \ncan fl  ow towards the bottom. Avoid very long time lapses to prevent the coating on the wells from drying up. Check that the suction system\u2019s needles are clean (free of obstructions). \u2022\u2022 Distributed V olume. Check that the volume distributed \nis as close as possible to the maximum capacity of the well; confi  rm that all the wells are fi  lled uniformly (at \nthe same level). Verify that the distributing needles are clean (free of obstructions). \u2022\u2022 Vacuum. The suctioning system must be calibrated \neffi  ciently. If the vacuum is too strong, the test can \nbe altered. In fact, it could dry out the wells and considerably weaken the enzyme activity in the wells and completely alter the test result. The majority of washers function with a vacuum ranging between 60 and 70% of atmospheric pressure. In some washers, the vacuum is made in an external pump which operates as an accessory of the washer. Its operation is controlled by the washer, which means that the vacuum pump operates only when required. Washing process veri\ufb01  cation \nTo verify that the washing process is done according to \nthe specifications of ELISA t echniques, manufacturers \nof ELISA tests have developed procedures to be carried out regularly. One of the controls\n1 is based on using the \nperoxidase reagent, which is dispensed using a pipette in the plate wells to be read at 405, 450 and 492 nm. At once the wells are washed and a colourless substrate is added (TMB\/H\n2O2\u2013Tetramethylbenzidine\/Hydrogen Peroxide). Whatever conjugate remains will hydrolyze the enzyme and the chromogen will change to blue. After stopping the reaction with acid, the TMB will turn yellow again. The resulting colour intensity is directly related to the washing process effi   ciency. INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS\nFor the microplate washer to operate correctly, the following \nis nec essary: \n1. A clean, dust-free environment.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Follow the instructions indicated in the manufacturer\u2019s \noperations manual.

ROUTINE MAINTENANCE\nThe balance is characterized as an instrument of high precision. For this reason, the operator is only responsible \nfor minimal maintenance limited to the following:\nDaily Activities\n1. Clean the weighing plate so that it is kept free of dust. Cleaning is done b y using a piece of clean cloth which \nmay be dampened with distilled water. If there is a stain, a mild detergent can be applied. Also a paintbrush with soft bristles can be used to remove particles or dust deposited on the weight plate. 2. Clean the weighing chamber, externally and internally. Verify that the glass is free from dust. 3. Verify that the adjustment mechanisms on the front \ndoor of the weighing chamber works adequately.4. Always use a clean, pre-weighed container for weighing \n(glass container or weighing paper if possible). Note that plastic can become electromagnetically charged and is not recommended for weighing powdered or granulated chemicals. 5.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>A combined electrode or probe.

Decontamination of the cabinet\nThe decontamination of the biological safety cabinet is an activity which must be done before any maintenance work \ninvolving opening its surfaces or internal components. Whenever any of the processes indicated next are needed, decontamination of the cabinet must be done previously.1. Changing of fi  lters. 2. Conducting tests requiring access to the interior surfaces \nor exposure of the cabinet. 3. Before conducting certifi  cation tests when the cabinet \nhas been used with classifi  ed agents such as level 2 or \n3 biological risk agents. 4.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>(abbreviation for molecule). A quantity of any substance whose mass expressed in grams is numerically equal to its atomic mass. Mole (unit). The amount of a substance that contains as many atoms, molecules, ions, or other elementary units as the number of atoms in 0. 012 kilogram of \ncarbon 12. It corresponds to the number 6.0225 \u00d7 1023, or Avogadro\u2019s number, also called gram molecule. The mass in grams of this amount of a substance, numerically equal to the molecular weight of the substance, also called gram-molecular weight. pH. Measurement of the concentration of the hydrogen ion (H+) given in moles per litre (M) in a solution. The pH concept was proposed by S\u00f8rensen and Lindstr\u00f8m-\nLang in 1909 to facilitate expressing very low ion concentrations. It is defi  ned by the following equation:pH = \u2013log [H\n+]      or      [H+] = 10-pH \nIt measures the acidity of a solution. Example, in water the concentration of [H+] is 1.0 x 10-7 M resulting in pH = 7. This allows the range of concentrations from \n1 to 10-14 M, to be expressed from zero (0) to 14. There are diverse systems for measuring the acidity of a solution. An acidic substance  dissolved in water is capable \nof producing H+ ions. A basic substance dissolved in water is capable of producing [OH\u2013] (hydroxides) ions. An acid substance has a greater quantity of ions [H+] than pure water; a basic substance shows greater quantities of ions [OH\u2013] than pure water. The concentrations \nof substances are expressed in moles per litre. In pure water, the ion concentration [H+] and [OH\u2013] is 1.0 x 10\u20137 M, it is thus considered a neutral substance. In reality, it is a weak electrolyte that is dissociated \nfollowing the following equation:H\n2O  '  [H+][OH\u2013] \nIn all aqueous solutions there is a balance expressed as:   \n[H+][OH\u2013] = K \n     H2O\nIf the solution is diluted, the concentration of the non-dissociated water can be considered constant:\n[H+][OH\u2013] = [H2O]K = Ka\nThe new constant Ka is called a constant of dissociation or ionic product of water and its value is 1.0x10\u201314 at 25 \u00b0C. [H+][OH\u2013] = 1.0 x 10-14\nX x X = 1.0 x 10-14\nX2 = 1.0 x 10-14\nX = 1.0 x 10-7\nIn pure water the concentrations of H+ and OH\u2013 are 1.0 x 10\u20137 M, a very low concentration, given that the molar concentration of water is 55.4 mol\/litre.

A process through which a fl  uid in liquid phase is heated until converted into vapour and then cooled and condensed back into liquid phase. The \ndistillation process is used for separating mixed substances, taking advantage of their diff  erence in volatility. To obtain ver y pure substances, consecutive distillation \ncycles are performed with the aim of progressively eliminating other substances present in the mix. Hardness (of water). A chemical characteristic of water determined by the carbonate, bicarbonate, chlorine, sulphate and occasionally calcium nitra te and \nmagnesium content. The resulting resistance is undesirable in some processes. There are two types of resistors in water. \u2022 Temporary hardness. This is determined by the magnesium and calcium carbonate and bicarbonate content. It may be eliminated by boiling the water a nd \nsubsequently fi  ltering out the precipitate. It is also known as carbonate resistance. \u2022 Permanent hardness. This is determined by all the calcium and magnesium salts, except the carbonates and bicarbonates. It cannot be eliminated by the \nboiling of water and it is also known as non-bicarbonate resistance.

It is expressed as ppm (parts per million) of calcium carbonate (CaCo3). Incrustation (scale). A name given to solids in suspension deposited in layers on the surface of water storage containers. Solution. A homogenous mix of two or more substances characterized by the absence of chemical reactions between the components of the li quid mixture. The \nliquid component which generally appears in greater proportion is called the solvent  and that found in a lesser quantity in solution, the solute .MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n59Chapter 9\nDilutor\nThe dilutor is used for diluting substances. Dilute comes \nfrom the Latin word diluere  and means to add liquid to a \nsolution. Solutions are defi  ned as homogeneous mixtures \nof two or more components which may be gaseous, liquid or solid. To dilute is to reduce the strength of a fl uid in a solvent, generally water. The dilutor facilitates \nthe preparation of liquid mixtures, until these achieve a proportion (concentration) suitable for use in different diagnostic processes. The identification of this type of equipment is generalized using the word dilutor.

OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nWater baths are made of steel and are generally c overed with electrostatic paint \nwith high adherence and resistance to environmental laboratory conditions. Water baths have an external panel on which the controls can be found. They also have a tank made of rustproof material with a collection of electrical resistors mounted on their lower part. By means of these, heat is transferred to the medium (water or oil) until reaching the temperature selected with a control device (thermostat or similar). The resistors may be of the following types:\u2022 Immersion type. These resistors are installed inside \na sealed tube and located on the lower part of the container in direct contact with heating medium. \u2022\u2022 External. These resistors are located on the lower part \nbut on the outside of the tank. These are protected by an isolating material which prevents heat loss. This type of resistor transfers the heat to the bottom of the tank through thermal conduction. The water bath is an instrument used in the laboratory for\n \u2022\n\u2022\nImmersion type. These resistors are installed iGMDN Code 36754 16772\nECRI Code 15-108 16-772\nDenomination Water bath Water bath, shaker\nFigure 16.

A table which describes the main types of water baths is shown below. WATER BATH CONTROLS\nWater baths generally have very simple controls. Some manufacturers have incorporated controls with \nmicroprocessors. They vary depending on the type of bath. The diagram of a basic water bath\u2019s control panel is shown next. The control panel has these elements:\n1. The on and off   control switch\n2. A Menu button for selecting the operation\u2019s parameters: \noperation temperature, alarm temperature, temperature scale (\u00b0C, \u00b0F)\n3. Two buttons for parameter adjustment4. A screen 5. A pilot light6. Pilots (2) for identifying the temperature scale (\u00b0C, \u00b0F). WATER BATH OPERATION\nInstallation\n1. Install the water bath close to an electrical outlet. The \noutlet must ha ve its respective ground pole in order \nto guarantee the protection and safety of the operator and the equipment. Water baths generally operate at 120 V\/60 Hz or 230 V\/60Hz. Its installation and use is facilitated by a sink close by for supplying and draining of water. 2. Verify that the location selected is levelled and has the \nnecessary resistance to safely support the weight of the water bath when it is full of liquid. 3. Ensure that the location has a suitable amount of space \nfor putting the samples and the accessories required for the normal operation of the water bath. 4. Avoid placing the water bath where there are strong air \ncurrents which can interfere with its normal operation. For example: in front of an air-conditioning unit or window. Safety\n1. Avoid the use of the water bath in environments where \nther e are fl  ammable and combustible materials. The \nequipment has components (resistors generating very high temperatures) which could start an accidental fi  re \nor explosion. 2. Always connect the equipment to an electrical outlet \nwith a ground pole to protect the user and the equipment from electrical discharges. The electrical connection must comply with the required norms of the country and the laboratory. 3. Use the water bath exclusively with non-corrosive or \nnon-fl  ammable liquids. 4. Use personal protective elements when working with \nthe water bath. The bath has resistors which can cause burns if inadvertently touched, even a considerable time after turning off   the equipment. 5. When working with substances that generate vapours, \nplace the water bath under a chemical hood or in a well ventilated area. 6. Remember that liquids incubated in the water bath tank \ncan produce burns if hands are inadvertently placed inside it. 7. Take into account that the water bath is designed for \nuse with a liquid inside the tank. If the inside is dry, the temperature of the tank can become very high. Use the diff  using tray for placing the container inside of the \nfi lled tank of the water bath. This has been designed for \ndistributing the temperature in a uniform way. 8. Avoid using the water bath if any of its controls is not \nworking, e.g. the temperature or limit controls.Class Temperature range \nLow temperature  Room temperature up to 60 \u00b0C \nRoom temperature up to 100 \u00b0C\nHigh temperature Room temperature up to 275 \u00b0C. When it needs to \nreach temperatures above 100 \u00b0C, it is necessary to use fl  uids other than water as the boiling point of water is 100 \u00b0C under normal conditions\nThis type of bath generally uses oils which have much \nhigher boiling points. Insulated Room temperature up to 100 \u00b0C with accessories and\/\nor agitation systems (with water).<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Place the calibration plate on the equipment. 2. Carry out a complete reading with the calibration plate. Verify if there are diff  erences in the readings obtained \nfrom well to well. If this is the case, invert the plate (180\u00b0) and repeat the reading to rule out that diff  erences are \nattributed to the plate itself. In general, it is accepted that the instrument does not need further calibration if the plate results are as expected at two wavelengths. 3. Verify if the reader requires calibration. If so, proceed \nwith the calibration following the routine outlined by the manufacturer, verifying that the reading\u2019s linearity is maintained as rigorously as possible. 4. If the instrument does not have a calibration plate, verify \nit by placing a coloured solution in the wells of a plate and immediately carry out a complete reading. Then invert the plate 180\u00b0 and read the plate again. If both readings display identical, average values in each row, the reader is calibrated. 5. Verify that the reader is calibrated, column by column. Place a clean, empty plate and carry out a reading. If there is no diff  erence between each of the average \nreading of the fi  rst to the last column, it can be assumed \nthat the reader is calibrated. ROUTINE MAINTENANCE \nMaintenance described next focuses exclusively on the micr oplate reader. The maintenance of the microplate \nwasher is described in Chapter 2. Basic maintenance \nFrequency: Daily1. Review that optical sensors of each channel are clean. If dirt is detected, clean the surface of the windows of the light emitters and the sensors with a small brush. 2. Confi  rm that the lighting system is clean. 3. Verify that the reader\u2019s calibration is adequate. When \nthe daily operations begin, let the reader warm up for 30 minutes. Next, do a blank reading and then read a full plate of substrate. The readings must be identical. If not, invert the plate and repeat the reading in order to determine if the deviation originated in the plate or the reader. 4. Examine the automatic drawer sliding system. It must \nbe smooth and constant.<\/DOCUMENT>\n1.

The \noutlet must ha ve its respective ground pole in order \nto guarantee the protection and safety of the operator and the equipment. Water baths generally operate at 120 V\/60 Hz or 230 V\/60Hz. Its installation and use is facilitated by a sink close by for supplying and draining of water. 2. Verify that the location selected is levelled and has the \nnecessary resistance to safely support the weight of the water bath when it is full of liquid. 3. Ensure that the location has a suitable amount of space \nfor putting the samples and the accessories required for the normal operation of the water bath. 4. Avoid placing the water bath where there are strong air \ncurrents which can interfere with its normal operation. For example: in front of an air-conditioning unit or window. Safety\n1. Avoid the use of the water bath in environments where \nther e are fl  ammable and combustible materials. The \nequipment has components (resistors generating very high temperatures) which could start an accidental fi  re \nor explosion. 2. Always connect the equipment to an electrical outlet \nwith a ground pole to protect the user and the equipment from electrical discharges. The electrical connection must comply with the required norms of the country and the laboratory. 3. Use the water bath exclusively with non-corrosive or \nnon-fl  ammable liquids. 4. Use personal protective elements when working with \nthe water bath. The bath has resistors which can cause burns if inadvertently touched, even a considerable time after turning off   the equipment. 5. When working with substances that generate vapours, \nplace the water bath under a chemical hood or in a well ventilated area. 6. Remember that liquids incubated in the water bath tank \ncan produce burns if hands are inadvertently placed inside it. 7. Take into account that the water bath is designed for \nuse with a liquid inside the tank. If the inside is dry, the temperature of the tank can become very high. Use the diff  using tray for placing the container inside of the \nfi lled tank of the water bath. This has been designed for \ndistributing the temperature in a uniform way. 8. Avoid using the water bath if any of its controls is not \nworking, e.g. the temperature or limit controls.Class Temperature range \nLow temperature  Room temperature up to 60 \u00b0C \nRoom temperature up to 100 \u00b0C\nHigh temperature Room temperature up to 275 \u00b0C. When it needs to \nreach temperatures above 100 \u00b0C, it is necessary to use fl  uids other than water as the boiling point of water is 100 \u00b0C under normal conditions\nThis type of bath generally uses oils which have much \nhigher boiling points.

The dilutor has in general, the following components:1. A propulsion system2. A control system3. A dispensing system\nPropulsion system\nThis is generally constituted of positive displacement systems as found in syringes. One or more selectable \nsyringes (with a varying capacity) is\/are used in the dilutor to control the volume to be mixed or diluted. The syringes\u2019 pistons are moved by a mechanism which controls their position. Aspirated volumes or deliveries are calculated by means of the following equation:\nWhere: \n\u2202 V =  fraction of the volume delivered by the syringe when the piston has a displacement   \u2202l.A =  piston area. The total volume aspirated or delivered is the corresponding \nintegral: \n where l\no and l1 correspond to the positions that defi  ne the \npiston\u2019s displacement.Controlling how the pistons move facilitates good control \nover the volumes handled. The displacement system is activated by an electric motor which moves a very precise nuts and screws system and changes the position of the piston. A set of valves controlling the aspiration and supply processes complements the syringes and their displacement systems. The confi  guration of the dilutor depends on the \nmodel and manufacturers. Control system\nModern dilutors have a control system which is automatic or controlled by microprocessors. The latter allow the following \nto be selected and controlled:1.

These are also cal led agitators.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>The vacuum may be supplied by external and internal pumps. Extraction is done by a set of needles mounted on the washer\/dryer\u2019s head. The number of needles varies from one to three, according to the washer model used. If it uses only one needle, the washing and \nextraction operation is done with this single needle. If it uses two needles, one is used for supplying the washing solution and the other for extraction. If it uses three needles, the fi  rst is used for supplying the washing \nsolution, the second for extraction and the third for controlling (extracting) any excess volume in the well. Generally, the extraction needle is longer than the supply needle, which enables it to advance (vertically) up to a height ranging between 0.3 and 0.5 mm from the bottom of the well. \u2022\u2022 Advance sub-system. This is composed of a \nmechanism which moves the supply and extraction head horizontally to reach each well in the ELISA plate. When the horizontal movement to the following row occurs, there is a vertical movement towards the well to dispense or extract the washing solution. There are washers which carry out these operations in a simultaneous manner.The sub-systems previously described are shown in Figure \n2. Figure 3 shows the diff  erent types of wells most commonly \nfound in microplates. Each kind of well is suitable for a particular type of test. Washing process\nThe washing of the microplate is one of the stages of the ELISA t echnique. Special solutions are used in the washing \nsteps. Among those most commonly used is phosphate buff er solution or PBS. The phosphate buff  er solution has a \nstability of 2 months if kept at 4 \u00b0C. It is estimated that 1 to 3 litres of solution is required for washing one microplate and that 300 \u00b5l is used in each well per cycle. Washing can \nbe done manually, but it is preferable to use an automated microplate washer for a better throughput and to minimize handling of potentially contaminated substances. Among the washing processes used by microplate washers \nare featured:\n\u2022\u2022 Aspir ation from top to bottom. When the aspiration \nphase is initiated, the needles move vertically and the aspiration is initiated immediately as these enter into the liquid. The process continues until the needles reach their lowest position very close to the bottom of the wells. At this point they are stopped in order to avoid suctioning the air that should fl  ow against the \ninterior lateral walls of the wells. This type of aspiration prevents air currents from drying the bound protein on the surface of the wells.

Well pro\ufb01  les MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n9\u2022\u2022 Simultaneous distribution and aspiration. In certain \ntypes of washer, the washing and aspiration systems operate simultaneously, generating a controlled turbulence inside the well which removes the unbound substances during the incubations. \u2022\u2022 Aspir ation from the base of the wells. In this system, \nthe aspiration of the fluid contained in the wells is performed initially with the aspiration needles in a position very close to the bottom, immediately beginning a suctioning cycle, usually time-controlled. This system may aspirate air if there are diff  erences in \nthe levels of the tanks. Washer calibration\nThe microplate washer is critical for guaranteeing that the ELISA t echnique performs as expected. The alignment to \nbe taken into account for the eff  ective functioning of the \nequipment is presented next:\n\u2022\u2022 Position of the needles (supply and aspiration head). The horizontal and vertical position adjustment with respect to the wells must be verifi  ed carefully. If the \nplate has fl  at bottom wells, the supply needle must be \nchecked to see that it is situated very close to the well\u2019s wall. If the bottom is round or V-shaped, the suction needle should be located in the centre of the well: upon the vertical movement, a needle-base distance is maintained in the well, usually between 0.3 to 0.5 mm. The needles must never be allowed to touch the bottom of the wells to avoid mechanical interferences between the needle point and the well\u2019s base during the aspiration function. \u2022\u2022 Aspir ation time. Appropriately adjust the aspiration \ntime so that a solution fi  lm adhered to the well\u2019s wall \ncan fl  ow towards the bottom. Avoid very long time lapses to prevent the coating on the wells from drying up. Check that the suction system\u2019s needles are clean (free of obstructions). \u2022\u2022 Distributed V olume. Check that the volume distributed \nis as close as possible to the maximum capacity of the well; confi  rm that all the wells are fi  lled uniformly (at \nthe same level). Verify that the distributing needles are clean (free of obstructions). \u2022\u2022 Vacuum. The suctioning system must be calibrated \neffi  ciently. If the vacuum is too strong, the test can \nbe altered. In fact, it could dry out the wells and considerably weaken the enzyme activity in the wells and completely alter the test result. The majority of washers function with a vacuum ranging between 60 and 70% of atmospheric pressure. In some washers, the vacuum is made in an external pump which operates as an accessory of the washer. Its operation is controlled by the washer, which means that the vacuum pump operates only when required. Washing process veri\ufb01  cation \nTo verify that the washing process is done according to \nthe specifications of ELISA t echniques, manufacturers \nof ELISA tests have developed procedures to be carried out regularly. One of the controls\n1 is based on using the \nperoxidase reagent, which is dispensed using a pipette in the plate wells to be read at 405, 450 and 492 nm. At once the wells are washed and a colourless substrate is added (TMB\/H\n2O2\u2013Tetramethylbenzidine\/Hydrogen Peroxide). Whatever conjugate remains will hydrolyze the enzyme and the chromogen will change to blue. After stopping the reaction with acid, the TMB will turn yellow again. The resulting colour intensity is directly related to the washing process effi   ciency. INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS\nFor the microplate washer to operate correctly, the following \nis nec essary: \n1.

A solution containing either a weak acid and its salt or, a weak base and its salt, which makes it resistant to changes in pH at a given temperature. PBS. One of the solutions used to perform washing operations in ELISA tests. PBS is the acronym for Phosphate Buff  er Solution. This  is made of the following \nsubstances: NaCl, KCl, NaHPO42H2O and KH2SO4. The manufacturers supply technical bulletins which indicate the proportions and instructions for preparing PBS. In \ngeneral, one part of concentrated PBS is mixed with 19 parts of deionised water. Plate (ELISA). Consumable with standard dimensions, designed to hold samples and reactions for the ELISA technique. In general, these have 96 , 384 or 1536 wells \nand are made of plastics such as polystyrene and polypropylene. There are plates specially treated to facilitate the performanc e of the tests. Positive displacement pump. A pump adjusted by a plunger moving along a cylinder. The mechanism is similar to that of a syringe. It is equipped with a set  of \nvalves for controlling the fl  ow to and from the pump. TMB\/H2O2.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>NSF . An acronym of the National Sanitation Foundation , a non-profi  t organization dedicated to research, education and service, which seeks to resolve problems \nrelated to human beings, promote health and enrichment of the quality of life through conservation and improvement of the envir onment. NSF standards supply \nthe basic criteria for promoting salubrious conditions and public health protection. Toxic. A substance with a physiologically adverse eff  ect on the biological systems. Ultraviolet light (UV). This is electromagnetic radiation, the wavelength of which is between 200 and 390 nm. It is used in biological safety cabinets  for its \ngermicidal properties.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>(abbreviation for molecule). A quantity of any substance whose mass expressed in grams is numerically equal to its atomic mass. Mole (unit). The amount of a substance that contains as many atoms, molecules, ions, or other elementary units as the number of atoms in 0. 012 kilogram of \ncarbon 12. It corresponds to the number 6.0225 \u00d7 1023, or Avogadro\u2019s number, also called gram molecule. The mass in grams of this amount of a substance, numerically equal to the molecular weight of the substance, also called gram-molecular weight. pH. Measurement of the concentration of the hydrogen ion (H+) given in moles per litre (M) in a solution. The pH concept was proposed by S\u00f8rensen and Lindstr\u00f8m-\nLang in 1909 to facilitate expressing very low ion concentrations. It is defi  ned by the following equation:pH = \u2013log [H\n+]      or      [H+] = 10-pH \nIt measures the acidity of a solution. Example, in water the concentration of [H+] is 1.0 x 10-7 M resulting in pH = 7. This allows the range of concentrations from \n1 to 10-14 M, to be expressed from zero (0) to 14. There are diverse systems for measuring the acidity of a solution. An acidic substance  dissolved in water is capable \nof producing H+ ions. A basic substance dissolved in water is capable of producing [OH\u2013] (hydroxides) ions. An acid substance has a greater quantity of ions [H+] than pure water; a basic substance shows greater quantities of ions [OH\u2013] than pure water. The concentrations \nof substances are expressed in moles per litre. In pure water, the ion concentration [H+] and [OH\u2013] is 1.0 x 10\u20137 M, it is thus considered a neutral substance. In reality, it is a weak electrolyte that is dissociated \nfollowing the following equation:H\n2O  '  [H+][OH\u2013] \nIn all aqueous solutions there is a balance expressed as:   \n[H+][OH\u2013] = K \n     H2O\nIf the solution is diluted, the concentration of the non-dissociated water can be considered constant:\n[H+][OH\u2013] = [H2O]K = Ka\nThe new constant Ka is called a constant of dissociation or ionic product of water and its value is 1.0x10\u201314 at 25 \u00b0C. [H+][OH\u2013] = 1.0 x 10-14\nX x X = 1.0 x 10-14\nX2 = 1.0 x 10-14\nX = 1.0 x 10-7\nIn pure water the concentrations of H+ and OH\u2013 are 1.0 x 10\u20137 M, a very low concentration, given that the molar concentration of water is 55.4 mol\/litre.

It is used in areas such as agriculture, water treatment and purifi  cation, in industrial \nprocesses such as petrochemicals, paper manufacture, foods, pharmaceuticals, research and development, metal mechanics, etc. In the health laboratory, its applications are related to the control of culture mediums and to the measurement of the alkalinity or acidity of broths and buff ers. In specialized laboratories, diagnostic equipment \nmicroelectrodes are used to measure the pH of liquid blood components. The plasma pH allows the patient\u2019s health to be evaluated. It normally measures between 7.35 and 7.45. This value relates to the patient\u2019s metabolism in which a multitude of reactions occurs where acids and bases are normally kept in balance. Acids constantly liberate hydrogen ions [H\n+] and the organism neutralizes or balances \nacidity by liberating bicarbonate ions [HCO3\u2013]. The acid-base \nratio in the organism is maintained by the kidneys, (organs in which any excesses present are eliminated).

OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nWater baths are made of steel and are generally c overed with electrostatic paint \nwith high adherence and resistance to environmental laboratory conditions. Water baths have an external panel on which the controls can be found. They also have a tank made of rustproof material with a collection of electrical resistors mounted on their lower part. By means of these, heat is transferred to the medium (water or oil) until reaching the temperature selected with a control device (thermostat or similar). The resistors may be of the following types:\u2022 Immersion type. These resistors are installed inside \na sealed tube and located on the lower part of the container in direct contact with heating medium. \u2022\u2022 External. These resistors are located on the lower part \nbut on the outside of the tank. These are protected by an isolating material which prevents heat loss. This type of resistor transfers the heat to the bottom of the tank through thermal conduction. The water bath is an instrument used in the laboratory for\n \u2022\n\u2022\nImmersion type. These resistors are installed iGMDN Code 36754 16772\nECRI Code 15-108 16-772\nDenomination Water bath Water bath, shaker\nFigure 16.

Immersion and external resistors    CHAPTER 5  WATER BATHS\n32Certain types of water bath have a series of accessories such \nas agitation systems or circulators, generating carefully controlled movement of the heating medium to keep the temperature uniform. A table which describes the main types of water baths is shown below. WATER BATH CONTROLS\nWater baths generally have very simple controls. Some manufacturers have incorporated controls with \nmicroprocessors. They vary depending on the type of bath. The diagram of a basic water bath\u2019s control panel is shown next. The control panel has these elements:\n1. The on and off   control switch\n2. A Menu button for selecting the operation\u2019s parameters: \noperation temperature, alarm temperature, temperature scale (\u00b0C, \u00b0F)\n3. Two buttons for parameter adjustment4. A screen 5. A pilot light6. Pilots (2) for identifying the temperature scale (\u00b0C, \u00b0F). WATER BATH OPERATION\nInstallation\n1. Install the water bath close to an electrical outlet. The \noutlet must ha ve its respective ground pole in order \nto guarantee the protection and safety of the operator and the equipment. Water baths generally operate at 120 V\/60 Hz or 230 V\/60Hz. Its installation and use is facilitated by a sink close by for supplying and draining of water. 2. Verify that the location selected is levelled and has the \nnecessary resistance to safely support the weight of the water bath when it is full of liquid. 3. Ensure that the location has a suitable amount of space \nfor putting the samples and the accessories required for the normal operation of the water bath. 4. Avoid placing the water bath where there are strong air \ncurrents which can interfere with its normal operation. For example: in front of an air-conditioning unit or window. Safety\n1. Avoid the use of the water bath in environments where \nther e are fl  ammable and combustible materials. The \nequipment has components (resistors generating very high temperatures) which could start an accidental fi  re \nor explosion. 2. Always connect the equipment to an electrical outlet \nwith a ground pole to protect the user and the equipment from electrical discharges. The electrical connection must comply with the required norms of the country and the laboratory. 3. Use the water bath exclusively with non-corrosive or \nnon-fl  ammable liquids. 4. Use personal protective elements when working with \nthe water bath. The bath has resistors which can cause burns if inadvertently touched, even a considerable time after turning off   the equipment. 5. When working with substances that generate vapours, \nplace the water bath under a chemical hood or in a well ventilated area. 6. Remember that liquids incubated in the water bath tank \ncan produce burns if hands are inadvertently placed inside it. 7. Take into account that the water bath is designed for \nuse with a liquid inside the tank. If the inside is dry, the temperature of the tank can become very high. Use the diff  using tray for placing the container inside of the \nfi lled tank of the water bath. This has been designed for \ndistributing the temperature in a uniform way. 8. Avoid using the water bath if any of its controls is not \nworking, e.g. the temperature or limit controls.Class Temperature range \nLow temperature  Room temperature up to 60 \u00b0C \nRoom temperature up to 100 \u00b0C\nHigh temperature Room temperature up to 275 \u00b0C. When it needs to \nreach temperatures above 100 \u00b0C, it is necessary to use fl  uids other than water as the boiling point of water is 100 \u00b0C under normal conditions\nThis type of bath generally uses oils which have much \nhigher boiling points. Insulated Room temperature up to 100 \u00b0C with accessories and\/\nor agitation systems (with water).<\/DOCUMENT>\n3. In what fields is a pH meter commonly used?

These syringes are selected and installed in the dilutor depending on the densities, viscosities, and volumes of fluids to be manipulated. The fluids are transported through flexible tubes, whose diameters, lengths and chemical compatibility are taken into account in the design and manufacturing process for suitability with the selected activity. These tubes are linked using connections manually adjustable.

The following table shows an example of how they are classifi  ed according to their size \nand managed volumes. Opposite, the components of the dispensing system (syringe \nand dispenser) are shown. INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS\nThe dilutor must be installed on a clean, dry and extremely levelled counter or work surface, far from areas where there \nmay be vapours which can aff  ect its functioning. There must be free space around the equipment for \nfacilitating ventilation and the passage of cables and interconnection lines and cables with the solvent containers, computers or supply systems. The space around the dilutor should be approximately 10 cm. There must be a 115 V, 60 Hz electrical outlet in good \ncondition with a ground pole or alternatively one of 220\u2013240 V, 50\/60 Hz, depending on the manufacturer\u2019s specifi  cations \nand\/or the electrical norms in the country of use.ROUTINE MAINTENANCE \nThe routine maintenance focuses mainly on eliminating contaminants which may accumulate inside the fluid \nmechanisms and\/or lines.

This is a balance with a single plate. An unknown mass is placed on the weighing plate. It is weighed by removing known masses from the counterweight side until it reaches a balanced position, using a mechanical system of cams. The fulcrum is generally off  -centre in relation to the length of the load \nbeam and located near the front of the balance. When a mass is placed on the weight plate and the balance\u2019s locking mechanism is released, the movement of the load beam is projected through an optical system to a screen located on the front part of the instrument. Operation veri\ufb01  cation\nThe procedure used for verifying the functioning of a typical \nmechanical balanc e is described below. The described \nprocess is based on the substitution balance.1. Verify that the balance is levelled. The levelling is \nachieved using a ring-shaped adjustment mechanism located on the base of the balance or by adjusting a bubble or knob on a scale located on the front of the balance\u2019s base. 2. Test the  zero mechanism. Place the controls on zero \nand free the balance. If the reading does not stay at zero, adjust the zero mechanism (a grooved screw located in a horizontal position near the fulcrum). To do this, it is necessary to block the balance and slightly adjust the mechanism. The process is to be continued until the zero adjusts correctly on the reading scale.3. Verify and adjust the sensitivity. This is always readjusted \nwhenever some internal adjustment is done. It is performed with a known standard according to the following steps:\na) Lock the balance.b) Place a standard weight (equivalent to the optical \nscale range) on the plate. c) Position the micro setting to one (1). d) Release the balance. e) Adjust to the zero position.f) Position the micro setting to zero (0). The balance \nshould indicate 100. If the scale displays less or more than 100, the sensitivity control must be adjusted. This requires locking the balance, opening the upper cover and turning the sensitivity screw: If the scale registers more than 100; turn the screw in a clockwise position. If the scale registers less than 100, it is necessary to unwind the screw anticlockwise. Repeat the process until the balance is adjusted (adjusting the zero and the sensitivity).Type of mass Capacity\nSimple pieces \n 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 g \n100, 200 and 500 g \nFractional pieces \n 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 mg \n100, 200 and 500 mg \nMass\nPlate\nFlexible\nConnections\nSupport ColumnFGFigure 10.

Verify if the tubes are reusable or not. If they are \ndisposable, use them only once. 5. For sterilizing, it is necessary to verify the material from \nwhich the tube is made, as not all can stand sterilization by heat. Glass tubes are normally sterilized with vapour at 121 \u00b0C for 30 minutes. 6. Store tubes and bottles in a dark, fresh, dry place, \nfar from chemical vapours or ultraviolet radiation sources. 7.

The dilutor has in general, the following components:1. A propulsion system2. A control system3. A dispensing system\nPropulsion system\nThis is generally constituted of positive displacement systems as found in syringes. One or more selectable \nsyringes (with a varying capacity) is\/are used in the dilutor to control the volume to be mixed or diluted. The syringes\u2019 pistons are moved by a mechanism which controls their position. Aspirated volumes or deliveries are calculated by means of the following equation:\nWhere: \n\u2202 V =  fraction of the volume delivered by the syringe when the piston has a displacement   \u2202l.A =  piston area. The total volume aspirated or delivered is the corresponding \nintegral: \n where l\no and l1 correspond to the positions that defi  ne the \npiston\u2019s displacement.Controlling how the pistons move facilitates good control \nover the volumes handled. The displacement system is activated by an electric motor which moves a very precise nuts and screws system and changes the position of the piston. A set of valves controlling the aspiration and supply processes complements the syringes and their displacement systems. The confi  guration of the dilutor depends on the \nmodel and manufacturers. Control system\nModern dilutors have a control system which is automatic or controlled by microprocessors. The latter allow the following \nto be selected and controlled:1.

The \ncentrifuge is designed to use the centrifugal force generated in rotational movements to separate the constitutive elements of a mixture. There is a wide range of centrifuges capable of serving specifi  c industry and research needs. This \nchapter focuses on standing centrifuges normally used in public health and clinical laboratories. PHOTOGRAPH OF CENTRIFUGEPURPOSE OF THE CENTRIFUGE\nThe centrifuge uses centrifugal force (the force generated \nwhen an objec t rotates around a single point), for separating \nsolids suspended in a liquid by sedimentation, or liquids of diverse density. The rotational movements allow forces much greater than gravity to be generated in controlled periods of time. In the laboratory, centrifuges are generally used in processes such as the separation of solid components from biological liquids through sedimentation and in particular of blood components: red cells, white cells, platelets among others and for conducting multiple tests and treatments.There are several kinds of centrifuges. The most widely used in public health, surveillance and clinical laboratories are the table-top centrifuge, the ultracentrifuge, the haeamatocrit centrifuge and the standing centrifuge. OPERATION PRINCIPLES \nCentrifuges represent a practical application of Newton\u2019s law of motion. When a body of mass [m] turns around \na central point [O], it is subjected to a centripetal  force \n[N] directed towards the rotation axis with a magnitude N = m\u03c9\n2R, where [m] is the mass of the body, [R] is the radius \nand \u03c9 is the angular speed. Centrifuges possess a rotating axis on which is mounted a rotor with sample receiving compartments. Tangential speed is defi  ned by the following \nequation: VT=\u03c9R. Photo courtesy of Beckman CoulterCHAPTER 7  CENTRIFUGE\n46When the system spins at a speed of \u03c9 radians per second, \nthe samples are subjected to the centrifugal force Fp of the \nsame magnitude as N, but in an opposite direction. The \nfi gure shown below1 features a diagram of the concept, \nof its actual application and of the obtained result. This Fp force acts on particles in the substance centrifuged, \ncausing them to separate as a result of diff  erences in density. Denser particles will settle at the bottom of the tube in shorter periods of time, while lighter ones require longer periods of time, settling onto those of greater density. The relationship between the centrifugal acceleration [\u03c9\n2r ] to a \ngiven radius [r] and the force of gravity [g] is known as the relative centrifugal fi  eld or [RCF]\n2. RCF =r\u03c92\ng\nThe RCF is the tool which allows rotors of different \nspecifi  cations to be compared when equivalent centrifugal \neff ects are required. COMPONENTS OF THE CENTRIFUGE \nThe most important components of a centrifuge are the \nfollowing3:\nThe electric\/electronic control which generally has the following elements:1. On and off control, operation time control (timer), \nrotation speed control (in some centrifuges), temperature control (in refrigerated centrifuges), vibration control (safety mechanism) and brake system.2.

Extraction is done by a set of needles mounted on the washer\/dryer\u2019s head. The number of needles varies from one to three, according to the washer model used. If it uses only one needle, the washing and \nextraction operation is done with this single needle. If it uses two needles, one is used for supplying the washing solution and the other for extraction. If it uses three needles, the fi  rst is used for supplying the washing \nsolution, the second for extraction and the third for controlling (extracting) any excess volume in the well. Generally, the extraction needle is longer than the supply needle, which enables it to advance (vertically) up to a height ranging between 0.3 and 0.5 mm from the bottom of the well. \u2022\u2022 Advance sub-system. This is composed of a \nmechanism which moves the supply and extraction head horizontally to reach each well in the ELISA plate. When the horizontal movement to the following row occurs, there is a vertical movement towards the well to dispense or extract the washing solution. There are washers which carry out these operations in a simultaneous manner.The sub-systems previously described are shown in Figure \n2. Figure 3 shows the diff  erent types of wells most commonly \nfound in microplates. Each kind of well is suitable for a particular type of test. Washing process\nThe washing of the microplate is one of the stages of the ELISA t echnique. Special solutions are used in the washing \nsteps. Among those most commonly used is phosphate buff er solution or PBS. The phosphate buff  er solution has a \nstability of 2 months if kept at 4 \u00b0C. It is estimated that 1 to 3 litres of solution is required for washing one microplate and that 300 \u00b5l is used in each well per cycle. Washing can \nbe done manually, but it is preferable to use an automated microplate washer for a better throughput and to minimize handling of potentially contaminated substances. Among the washing processes used by microplate washers \nare featured:\n\u2022\u2022 Aspir ation from top to bottom. When the aspiration \nphase is initiated, the needles move vertically and the aspiration is initiated immediately as these enter into the liquid. The process continues until the needles reach their lowest position very close to the bottom of the wells. At this point they are stopped in order to avoid suctioning the air that should fl  ow against the \ninterior lateral walls of the wells. This type of aspiration prevents air currents from drying the bound protein on the surface of the wells.

In certain \ntypes of washer, the washing and aspiration systems operate simultaneously, generating a controlled turbulence inside the well which removes the unbound substances during the incubations. \u2022\u2022 Aspir ation from the base of the wells. In this system, \nthe aspiration of the fluid contained in the wells is performed initially with the aspiration needles in a position very close to the bottom, immediately beginning a suctioning cycle, usually time-controlled. This system may aspirate air if there are diff  erences in \nthe levels of the tanks. Washer calibration\nThe microplate washer is critical for guaranteeing that the ELISA t echnique performs as expected. The alignment to \nbe taken into account for the eff  ective functioning of the \nequipment is presented next:\n\u2022\u2022 Position of the needles (supply and aspiration head). The horizontal and vertical position adjustment with respect to the wells must be verifi  ed carefully. If the \nplate has fl  at bottom wells, the supply needle must be \nchecked to see that it is situated very close to the well\u2019s wall. If the bottom is round or V-shaped, the suction needle should be located in the centre of the well: upon the vertical movement, a needle-base distance is maintained in the well, usually between 0.3 to 0.5 mm. The needles must never be allowed to touch the bottom of the wells to avoid mechanical interferences between the needle point and the well\u2019s base during the aspiration function. \u2022\u2022 Aspir ation time. Appropriately adjust the aspiration \ntime so that a solution fi  lm adhered to the well\u2019s wall \ncan fl  ow towards the bottom. Avoid very long time lapses to prevent the coating on the wells from drying up. Check that the suction system\u2019s needles are clean (free of obstructions). \u2022\u2022 Distributed V olume. Check that the volume distributed \nis as close as possible to the maximum capacity of the well; confi  rm that all the wells are fi  lled uniformly (at \nthe same level). Verify that the distributing needles are clean (free of obstructions). \u2022\u2022 Vacuum. The suctioning system must be calibrated \neffi  ciently. If the vacuum is too strong, the test can \nbe altered. In fact, it could dry out the wells and considerably weaken the enzyme activity in the wells and completely alter the test result. The majority of washers function with a vacuum ranging between 60 and 70% of atmospheric pressure. In some washers, the vacuum is made in an external pump which operates as an accessory of the washer. Its operation is controlled by the washer, which means that the vacuum pump operates only when required. Washing process veri\ufb01  cation \nTo verify that the washing process is done according to \nthe specifications of ELISA t echniques, manufacturers \nof ELISA tests have developed procedures to be carried out regularly. One of the controls\n1 is based on using the \nperoxidase reagent, which is dispensed using a pipette in the plate wells to be read at 405, 450 and 492 nm. At once the wells are washed and a colourless substrate is added (TMB\/H\n2O2\u2013Tetramethylbenzidine\/Hydrogen Peroxide). Whatever conjugate remains will hydrolyze the enzyme and the chromogen will change to blue. After stopping the reaction with acid, the TMB will turn yellow again. The resulting colour intensity is directly related to the washing process effi   ciency. INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS\nFor the microplate washer to operate correctly, the following \nis nec essary: \n1. A clean, dust-free environment.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>The balance has other names \nsuch as scale and weight. It must be taken into account that the weight is the force which the gravitational fi  eld exercises on a body\u2019s mass, this force being the product of the mass \nby the local acceleration of gravity [F = m x g]. The term local is used to emphasize that this acceleration depends on factors such as the geographical latitude, altitude and the Earth\u2019s density where the measurement is taken. This force is measured in Newtons.

In the laboratory, the balance is used \nfor weighing as part of quality control activities (on devices like pipettes), in the preparation of mixtures of components in predefined proportions and in the determination of specifi  c densities or weights. OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThere are diff  erences in design, principles and criteria of \nmetrology amongst balances. At present, there are two large groups of balances: mechanical and electronic balances. Mechanical balances \nThe following are some of the more common ones: 1. Spring balance. Its function is based on a mechanical \nproperty of springs as the force exercised on a spring is proportional to the spring\u2019s elasticity constant [k], multiplied by its elongation [x] [F = -kx]. The greater the mass [m] placed on the balance\u2019s plate, the greater the elongation will be, given that the elongation is proportional to the mass and the spring\u2019s constant. The calibration of a spring balance depends on the force of gravity acting on the object weighed. This type of balance is used when great precision is not necessary. 2. Sliding weight balance. This type of balance is \nequipped with two known weights which can be moved on setting scales (one macro, the other micro). Upon placing a substance of unknown mass on the tray, its weight is determined by moving the weight on both setting scales until the equilibrium position is reached. At this point, the weight is obtained by adding both quantities indicated by the sliding masses\u2019 position on the scale. 3. Analytical balance. This balance functions by comparing \nknown weight masses with that of a substance of unknown weight. It is composed of a base on a bar or symmetrical lever, maintained by a blade-like support on a central point called a fulcrum. At its ends, there are stirrups, also supported with blades which allow these to oscillate smoothly. From there, two plates are suspended. Certifi  ed weights are placed on one \nof the plates and unknown weights on the other. The balance has a securing system or lock, which allows the main lever to remain stable when not in use or when it is necessary to modify the counter-weights. The balance is inside an external box which protects it from interferences, such as air currents. Analytical balances can weigh ten thousandths of a gram (0.0001 g) or 100 thousandths of a gram (0.00001 g). This type of balance generally has a capacity of up to 200 grams.

Analytical balance  MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n23It is necessary to have a set of certifi  ed masses. The set is \ngenerally composed of the following pieces:\n4. Upper plate balance (Top loading or parallel guidance \nbalance). This type of balance has a loading plate located \non its upper part, supported by a column maintained in a vertical position by two pairs of guides with fl  exible \nconnections. The eff  ect of the force produced by the \nmass is transmitted from a point on the vertical column directly or by some mechanical means to the loading cell. The requirement with this type of mechanism is that parallel guides must be maintained with exactitude of up to \u00b1 1  \u00b5m. Deviations in parallelism cause an error known \nas lateral load (when the mass being weighed shows diff erences if the reading is taken at the centre of the \nplate or on one of its sides). The diagram shown below explains the operation principle some manufacturers have introduced in electronic balances.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Any spill must be cleaned immediately to avoid corrosion \nor contamination. Use 70% ethanol to disinfect the pan of the balance. Very important:  Never lubricate a balance unless the \nmanufacturer has expressly indicated it. Any substance interfering with the mechanism of the balance retards its response or defi  nitely alters the measurement process. Note:  In general, the manufacturer or the specialized \ninstallation representative carries out the maintenance of the balances, according to procedures which vary depending on the type and model. 1 Guidelines for calibration in laboratories, Drinking Water Inspectorate by \nLGC (Teddington) Ltd., December 2000.

The microplate washer performs the washing of the ELISA plate\u2019s wells during the diff  erent stages of the technique. PHOTOGRAPH OF MICROPLATE WASHER \nPURPOSE OF THE MICROPLATE WASHER \nThe microplate washer has been designed to supply cleaning \nbuff ers required for the ELISA technique in a controlled \nmanner. In the same fashion, the equipment removes from each well, substances in excess from the reaction. Depending on the test performed, the washer can intervene from one to four times, supplying the washing buff  er, agitating and \nremoving the unbound reagents\n1 until the programmed \ntimes and cycles are completed. The washer has of two reservoirs; one for the washing buff  er, the other for the waste \ngenerated during the washing process.OPERATION PRINCIPLES \nThe microplate washer has been designed to perform washing operations in the ELISA t echnique. The equipment \npossesses at least, the following subsystems which vary depending on the manufacturer\u2019s design. \u2022\u2022 Control subsystem. Generally , the washer is controlled \nby microprocessors allowing programming and controlling steps to be performed by the washer such as: number of washing cycles\n2 (1\u20135); expected times; \nsupplying and extracting pressures; plate format (96\u2013384 wells); suction function adjustment according to the type of well\n3 (fl at bottom, V bottom or rounded \nbottom or strips used); volumes distributed or aspirated; the soaking and agitation cycles, etc. \u2022\u2022 Supply subsystem. In general, this comprises a reservoir \nfor the washing solution; one or several pumps; usually a positive displacement type syringe and a dispenser head that supplies the washing solution to the diff  erent \nwells by means of needles. The head usually comes with eight pairs of needles for washing and aspirating simultaneously the wells of the same row (the supply and extraction sub-systems converge on the head). There are models with twelve pairs of needles and others that conduct the washing process simultaneously in all the wells. Some washers off  er the possibility of working \nwith diff  erent types of washing solutions, performing \nthe solution changes according to the program entered by the operator. 1 See a brief explication of the ELISA technique in Chapter 1, Microplate \nReader . 2 The exact number of washing operations required depends on the assay \nused.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>(abbreviation for molecule). A quantity of any substance whose mass expressed in grams is numerically equal to its atomic mass. Mole (unit). The amount of a substance that contains as many atoms, molecules, ions, or other elementary units as the number of atoms in 0. 012 kilogram of \ncarbon 12. It corresponds to the number 6.0225 \u00d7 1023, or Avogadro\u2019s number, also called gram molecule. The mass in grams of this amount of a substance, numerically equal to the molecular weight of the substance, also called gram-molecular weight. pH. Measurement of the concentration of the hydrogen ion (H+) given in moles per litre (M) in a solution. The pH concept was proposed by S\u00f8rensen and Lindstr\u00f8m-\nLang in 1909 to facilitate expressing very low ion concentrations. It is defi  ned by the following equation:pH = \u2013log [H\n+]      or      [H+] = 10-pH \nIt measures the acidity of a solution. Example, in water the concentration of [H+] is 1.0 x 10-7 M resulting in pH = 7. This allows the range of concentrations from \n1 to 10-14 M, to be expressed from zero (0) to 14. There are diverse systems for measuring the acidity of a solution. An acidic substance  dissolved in water is capable \nof producing H+ ions. A basic substance dissolved in water is capable of producing [OH\u2013] (hydroxides) ions. An acid substance has a greater quantity of ions [H+] than pure water; a basic substance shows greater quantities of ions [OH\u2013] than pure water. The concentrations \nof substances are expressed in moles per litre. In pure water, the ion concentration [H+] and [OH\u2013] is 1.0 x 10\u20137 M, it is thus considered a neutral substance. In reality, it is a weak electrolyte that is dissociated \nfollowing the following equation:H\n2O  '  [H+][OH\u2013] \nIn all aqueous solutions there is a balance expressed as:   \n[H+][OH\u2013] = K \n     H2O\nIf the solution is diluted, the concentration of the non-dissociated water can be considered constant:\n[H+][OH\u2013] = [H2O]K = Ka\nThe new constant Ka is called a constant of dissociation or ionic product of water and its value is 1.0x10\u201314 at 25 \u00b0C. [H+][OH\u2013] = 1.0 x 10-14\nX x X = 1.0 x 10-14\nX2 = 1.0 x 10-14\nX = 1.0 x 10-7\nIn pure water the concentrations of H+ and OH\u2013 are 1.0 x 10\u20137 M, a very low concentration, given that the molar concentration of water is 55.4 mol\/litre.

Use titanium rotors if working with saline solutions \nfrequently. 8. Protect the rotors\u2019 coating in order to avoid the metal \nbase from deteriorating. Do not use alkaline detergents or cleaning solutions which can remove the protective fi lm. The rotors generally made of aluminium [Al] are \ncovered by a fi  lm of anodized aluminium which protects \ntheir metal structure. 9. Use plastic brushes when cleaning the rotor. Metal \nbrushes scratch the protective coating and generate sources for future corrosion. Corrosion is accelerated in operation conditions and shortens the rotor\u2019s operational life. 10. If there are spills of corrosive substances, wash the rotor \nimmediately. 11. Air dry the rotor once cleaned and washed with water.12. Store vertical tube rotors and almost vertical tube rotors \nwith the larger side facing downwards and without their covers. 13. Store rotors in a dry area. Avoid leaving them in the \ncentrifuge. 14. Store swinging buckets rotors without the compartments\u2019 \ncovers. 15. Lubricate spiral and O-rings, according to the \nmanufacturer\u2019s recommendation. 16. Observe re commendations related to guaranteed times \nand operational life of each type of rotor. 17. Av oid using rotors whose operational lives have \nended. 18. Use a shield if working with radioactive material. 19. Load or unload rotors inside a biological safety cabinet \nif working with materials classifi  ed as Biosafety level II \nor higher. 20. Never try to open the cover of a centrifuge while it is \nfunctioning and never try to stop the rotor by hand. Tubes \nTube care includes aspects such as fi  lling of the tubes, adequat e temperature selection, centrifugation speed \nlimitations, washing and sterilization. The principle recommendations are the following:1. Wash tubes, adaptors and other accessories by hand \nusing a 1:10 mild detergent solution in water and a soft textured brush (not metallic). Avoid using automatic dishwashers. 2. Avoid using alcohol and acetone since such liquids aff  ect \nthe structure of the tubes. Manufacturers recommend the solvent to be used with each type of centrifugation tube material. 3. Avoid drying tubes in a drying oven. Dry always with a \nstream of hot air.4. Verify if the tubes are reusable or not. If they are \ndisposable, use them only once. 5. For sterilizing, it is necessary to verify the material from \nwhich the tube is made, as not all can stand sterilization by heat. Glass tubes are normally sterilized with vapour at 121 \u00b0C for 30 minutes. 6. Store tubes and bottles in a dark, fresh, dry place, \nfar from chemical vapours or ultraviolet radiation sources. 7. Verify maximum fi  lling levels and the sealing of thin \nwall tubes in order to avoid collapse inside the rotor by the action of the centrifugal force. Comply with manufacturers recommendations. Preventive maintenance\nWarning:  Nev er carry out a technical intervention in a \ncentrifuge if it has not been previously decontaminated. The most important maintenance routines performed on a \ncentrifuge are the following:Frequency: Monthly1. Verify that the centrifuge external components are free \nof dust and stains. Avoid aff  ecting the rotor with spills. Clean the rotor compartment using a mild detergent. 2. Test that the rotors\u2019 connecting and adjustment \nmechanisms are in good condition. Keep the points lubricated as the manufacturer recommends. 3. Verify the locking \/safety mechanism of the centrifuge\u2019s \ncover.

The \ncentrifuge is designed to use the centrifugal force generated in rotational movements to separate the constitutive elements of a mixture. There is a wide range of centrifuges capable of serving specifi  c industry and research needs. This \nchapter focuses on standing centrifuges normally used in public health and clinical laboratories. PHOTOGRAPH OF CENTRIFUGEPURPOSE OF THE CENTRIFUGE\nThe centrifuge uses centrifugal force (the force generated \nwhen an objec t rotates around a single point), for separating \nsolids suspended in a liquid by sedimentation, or liquids of diverse density. The rotational movements allow forces much greater than gravity to be generated in controlled periods of time. In the laboratory, centrifuges are generally used in processes such as the separation of solid components from biological liquids through sedimentation and in particular of blood components: red cells, white cells, platelets among others and for conducting multiple tests and treatments.There are several kinds of centrifuges. The most widely used in public health, surveillance and clinical laboratories are the table-top centrifuge, the ultracentrifuge, the haeamatocrit centrifuge and the standing centrifuge. OPERATION PRINCIPLES \nCentrifuges represent a practical application of Newton\u2019s law of motion. When a body of mass [m] turns around \na central point [O], it is subjected to a centripetal  force \n[N] directed towards the rotation axis with a magnitude N = m\u03c9\n2R, where [m] is the mass of the body, [R] is the radius \nand \u03c9 is the angular speed. Centrifuges possess a rotating axis on which is mounted a rotor with sample receiving compartments. Tangential speed is defi  ned by the following \nequation: VT=\u03c9R. Photo courtesy of Beckman CoulterCHAPTER 7  CENTRIFUGE\n46When the system spins at a speed of \u03c9 radians per second, \nthe samples are subjected to the centrifugal force Fp of the \nsame magnitude as N, but in an opposite direction. The \nfi gure shown below1 features a diagram of the concept, \nof its actual application and of the obtained result. This Fp force acts on particles in the substance centrifuged, \ncausing them to separate as a result of diff  erences in density. Denser particles will settle at the bottom of the tube in shorter periods of time, while lighter ones require longer periods of time, settling onto those of greater density. The relationship between the centrifugal acceleration [\u03c9\n2r ] to a \ngiven radius [r] and the force of gravity [g] is known as the relative centrifugal fi  eld or [RCF]\n2. RCF =r\u03c92\ng\nThe RCF is the tool which allows rotors of different \nspecifi  cations to be compared when equivalent centrifugal \neff ects are required. COMPONENTS OF THE CENTRIFUGE \nThe most important components of a centrifuge are the \nfollowing3:\nThe electric\/electronic control which generally has the following elements:1. On and off control, operation time control (timer), \nrotation speed control (in some centrifuges), temperature control (in refrigerated centrifuges), vibration control (safety mechanism) and brake system.2.

This information, along with good use and care, helps to maintain laboratory equipment in optimal condition.MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n1The microplate reader also known as \u201cPhotometric \nmicro-plate reader or ELISA reader\u201d is a specialized spectrophotometer designed to read results of the ELISA test, a technique used to determine the presence of antibodies or specifi  c antigens in samples. The technique \nis based on the detection of an antigen or antibodies captured on a solid surface using direct or secondary, labelled antibodies, producing a reaction whose product can be read by the spectrophotometer. The word ELISA is the acronym for \u201cEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay\u201d . This chapter covers the use of microplate readers for ELISA testing. For additional information on the instrument principles of operation and maintenance, consult Chapter 11 discussing the spectrophotometer. PHOTOGRAPH OF MICROPLATE READER\nPURPOSE OF THE MICROPLATE READER\nThe microplate reader is used for reading the results of ELISA \ntests. This technique has a direct application in immunology and serology. Among other applications it confi  rms the \npresence of antibodies or antigens of an infectious agent in an organism, antibodies from a vaccine or auto-antibodies, for example in rheumatoid arthritis.OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThe microplate reader is a specialized spectrophotometer. Unlike the c onventional spectrophotometer which facilitates \nreadings on a wide range of wavelengths, the microplate reader has filters or diffraction gratings that limit the wavelength range to that used in ELISA, generally between 400 to 750 nm (nanometres). Some readers operate in the ultraviolet range and carry out analyses between 340 to 700 nm. The optical system exploited by many manufacturers uses optic fi  bres to supply light to the microplate wells \ncontaining the samples. The light beam, passing through the sample has a diameter ranging between 1 to 3 mm. A detection system detects the light coming from the sample, amplifi  es the signal and determines the sample\u2019s \nabsorbance. A reading system converts it into data allowing the test result interpretation. Some microplate readers use double beam light systems. Test samples are located in specially designed plates with \na specifi  c number of wells where the procedure or test is \ncarried out. Plates of 8 columns by 12 rows with a total of 96 wells are common. There are also plates with a greater number of wells. For specialized applications, the current trend is to increase the number of wells (384-well plates) to reduce the amount of reagents and samples used and a greater throughput. The location of the optical sensors of the microplate reader varies depending on the manufacturers: these can be located above the sample plate, or directly underneath the plate\u2019s wells. Nowadays microplate readers have controls regulated by \nmicroprocessors; connection interfaces to information systems; quality and process control programs, which by means of a computer, allow complete test automation.Chapter 1\nMicroplate Reader\nGMDN Code 37036\nECRI Code 16-979\nDenomination Photometric micro-plate reader\nPhoto courtesy of BioRad Laboratories CHAPTER 1  MICROPLATE READER\n2Equipment required for ELISA testing\nIn order to perform the ELISA technique, the following \nequipment is r equired:  \n1.

The reference electrode is usually made of the same type of material as the internal electrode. Both tubes, interior and exterior, contain a reference solution. Only the outer tube has contact with the measured solution through a porous cap which acts as a saline bridge. This device acts like a galvanized cell. The reference electrode \nis the internal tube of the pH meter probe, which cannot lose ions through interactions with the surrounding environment. Therefore as a reference, it remains static (unchangeable) during the measuring process. The external tube of the probe contains the medium which is allowed  to mix with the external environment. As a result, this tube must be fi lled periodically with a potassium chloride solution (KCI) \nfor restoring the capacity of the electrode which would otherwise be inhibited by a loss of ions and evaporation. The glass bulb on the lower part of the pH electrode acts \nas a measuring element and is covered with a layer of hydrated gel on its exterior and interior. Metallic sodium cations [Na\n+] are diff  used in the hydrated gel outside of \nthe glass and in the solution, while the hydrogen ions [H+] \nare diff  used in the gel. This gel makes the pH electrode \nion-selective:  Hydrogen ions [H+] cannot pass through the \nglass membrane of the pH electrode. Sodium ions [Na+] pass \nthrough and cause a change in free energy, which the pH meter measures. A brief explanation of the theory on how electrodes function is included in the appendix at the end of the chapter.pH METER COMPONENTS \nA pH meter generally has the following components: 1. The body of the instrument containing the circuits, \ncontrols, connectors, display screens and measuring scales. The following are among some of its most \nimportant components:\na) An ON and OFF switch. Not all pH meters have an \non and off   switch. Some simply have a cord with a \nplug which allows it to be connected to a suitable electrical outlet. b) Temperature control. This control allows \nadjustments according to the temperature of the solution measured. c) Calibration controls. Depending on the design, \npH meters possess one or two calibration buttons or dials. Normally these are identifi  ed by Cal 1  and \nCal 2 . If the pH meter is calibrated using only one \nsolution, the Cal 1 button is used; making sure that Cal 2 is set at a 100%. If the pH meter allows  two point calibrations, two known pH solutions covering the range of pH to be measured are used. In this case, the two controls are used (Cal 1 and Cal 2). In special cases, a three-point calibration must be done (using three known pH solutions). d) Mode selector.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>In reality, there are always interactions or interferences with other types of ions present in the solution. A pH electrode is generally a combined electrode, in which a reference electrode and an internal glass electrode are integrated into a combined probe.

Place electrodes in the calibration solution. 2.1 Submerge the electrode in the standardization \nsolution in such a manner that its lower extremity does not touch the bottom of the beaker. This decreases the risk of breaking the electrode. If the test requires that the solution be kept in motion using the magnetic agitator, special care must be taken so that the agitation rod does not hit the electrode as this could break it. Buff  er solution \nis used as a calibration solution, because its pH is known and therefore will still be maintained even if a little contamination occurs.

The \ncentrifuge is designed to use the centrifugal force generated in rotational movements to separate the constitutive elements of a mixture. There is a wide range of centrifuges capable of serving specifi  c industry and research needs. This \nchapter focuses on standing centrifuges normally used in public health and clinical laboratories. PHOTOGRAPH OF CENTRIFUGEPURPOSE OF THE CENTRIFUGE\nThe centrifuge uses centrifugal force (the force generated \nwhen an objec t rotates around a single point), for separating \nsolids suspended in a liquid by sedimentation, or liquids of diverse density. The rotational movements allow forces much greater than gravity to be generated in controlled periods of time. In the laboratory, centrifuges are generally used in processes such as the separation of solid components from biological liquids through sedimentation and in particular of blood components: red cells, white cells, platelets among others and for conducting multiple tests and treatments.There are several kinds of centrifuges. The most widely used in public health, surveillance and clinical laboratories are the table-top centrifuge, the ultracentrifuge, the haeamatocrit centrifuge and the standing centrifuge. OPERATION PRINCIPLES \nCentrifuges represent a practical application of Newton\u2019s law of motion. When a body of mass [m] turns around \na central point [O], it is subjected to a centripetal  force \n[N] directed towards the rotation axis with a magnitude N = m\u03c9\n2R, where [m] is the mass of the body, [R] is the radius \nand \u03c9 is the angular speed. Centrifuges possess a rotating axis on which is mounted a rotor with sample receiving compartments. Tangential speed is defi  ned by the following \nequation: VT=\u03c9R. Photo courtesy of Beckman CoulterCHAPTER 7  CENTRIFUGE\n46When the system spins at a speed of \u03c9 radians per second, \nthe samples are subjected to the centrifugal force Fp of the \nsame magnitude as N, but in an opposite direction. The \nfi gure shown below1 features a diagram of the concept, \nof its actual application and of the obtained result. This Fp force acts on particles in the substance centrifuged, \ncausing them to separate as a result of diff  erences in density. Denser particles will settle at the bottom of the tube in shorter periods of time, while lighter ones require longer periods of time, settling onto those of greater density. The relationship between the centrifugal acceleration [\u03c9\n2r ] to a \ngiven radius [r] and the force of gravity [g] is known as the relative centrifugal fi  eld or [RCF]\n2. RCF =r\u03c92\ng\nThe RCF is the tool which allows rotors of different \nspecifi  cations to be compared when equivalent centrifugal \neff ects are required. COMPONENTS OF THE CENTRIFUGE \nThe most important components of a centrifuge are the \nfollowing3:\nThe electric\/electronic control which generally has the following elements:1. On and off control, operation time control (timer), \nrotation speed control (in some centrifuges), temperature control (in refrigerated centrifuges), vibration control (safety mechanism) and brake system.2.

The technique \nis based on the detection of an antigen or antibodies captured on a solid surface using direct or secondary, labelled antibodies, producing a reaction whose product can be read by the spectrophotometer. The word ELISA is the acronym for \u201cEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay\u201d . This chapter covers the use of microplate readers for ELISA testing. For additional information on the instrument principles of operation and maintenance, consult Chapter 11 discussing the spectrophotometer. PHOTOGRAPH OF MICROPLATE READER\nPURPOSE OF THE MICROPLATE READER\nThe microplate reader is used for reading the results of ELISA \ntests. This technique has a direct application in immunology and serology. Among other applications it confi  rms the \npresence of antibodies or antigens of an infectious agent in an organism, antibodies from a vaccine or auto-antibodies, for example in rheumatoid arthritis.OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThe microplate reader is a specialized spectrophotometer. Unlike the c onventional spectrophotometer which facilitates \nreadings on a wide range of wavelengths, the microplate reader has filters or diffraction gratings that limit the wavelength range to that used in ELISA, generally between 400 to 750 nm (nanometres). Some readers operate in the ultraviolet range and carry out analyses between 340 to 700 nm. The optical system exploited by many manufacturers uses optic fi  bres to supply light to the microplate wells \ncontaining the samples. The light beam, passing through the sample has a diameter ranging between 1 to 3 mm. A detection system detects the light coming from the sample, amplifi  es the signal and determines the sample\u2019s \nabsorbance. A reading system converts it into data allowing the test result interpretation. Some microplate readers use double beam light systems. Test samples are located in specially designed plates with \na specifi  c number of wells where the procedure or test is \ncarried out. Plates of 8 columns by 12 rows with a total of 96 wells are common. There are also plates with a greater number of wells. For specialized applications, the current trend is to increase the number of wells (384-well plates) to reduce the amount of reagents and samples used and a greater throughput. The location of the optical sensors of the microplate reader varies depending on the manufacturers: these can be located above the sample plate, or directly underneath the plate\u2019s wells. Nowadays microplate readers have controls regulated by \nmicroprocessors; connection interfaces to information systems; quality and process control programs, which by means of a computer, allow complete test automation.Chapter 1\nMicroplate Reader\nGMDN Code 37036\nECRI Code 16-979\nDenomination Photometric micro-plate reader\nPhoto courtesy of BioRad Laboratories CHAPTER 1  MICROPLATE READER\n2Equipment required for ELISA testing\nIn order to perform the ELISA technique, the following \nequipment is r equired:  \n1. Microplate reader.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>A clean, dust free environment with a fi  rm levelled \nfl oor. 3. If the centrifuge is refrigerated, it needs a free space on \nthe side of the condenser for adequate heat transfer. 4. A cabinet in which the centrifuge accessories such as \nthe alternate rotors can be kept. ROUTINE MAINTENANCE\nThe routine maintenance required by a centrifuge depends on multiple fac tors such as the incorporated technology, \nusage intensity, training of users, quality of the electrical feed and environmental conditions. The following are general recommendations regarding adequate use and most common maintenance for guaranteeing correct operation. The routines or specialized repairs will depend on manufacturers\u2019 recommendations for each brand and model. Always disinfect the rotor bowl, centrifuge head, buckets and trunnion rings as applicable before any servicing of centrifuges used to prepare clinical or infectious samples. Priority recommendation. Verify that only qualifi  ed personnel \ntrained and familiar with the use, care, risks and handling of the centrifuge operates it. It is the laboratory directors\u2019 responsibility to supervise and take necessary precautions so that personnel operating centrifuges understand the implications of working with such equipment. APPROPRIATE MANAGEMENT AND STORAGE RECOMMEND ATIONS\n1\nRotors\n1. Register the date of purchase of each one of the rotors, \nincluding inf ormation related to the serial and model \nnumber. 2. Read and understand the rotor manuals, equipment \nand tubes before use. Comply with indications for use and care specifi  ed by the manufacturer. 3. Use rotors only in centrifuges for which these have \nbeen manufactured. Do not interchange rotors without verifying the compatibility with the centrifuge. 4. Register operation parameters for each rotor in a log \nbook in order to determine its remaining operational life and to acquire its replacements when needed. 5. Use the recommendations regarding maximum speed \nand sample density from the manufacturer. Each rotor is designed for supporting a maximum level of eff  ort; \nthese specifi  cations must be followed rigorously. 1 http:\/\/www.sunysb.edu\/facilities\/ehs\/lab\/cs.shtmlk=lnrmaxrmin ()\n\u03c92\u00d71013\n3600MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n49\n6.

A platform of high \ninertia, isolated from the structures located in its vicinity is ideal to reduce the eff  ect of vibrations from certain \nequipment such as centrifuges and refrigerators. There must be a large enough area for installing the balance and any auxiliary equipment needed during the weighing processes. Likewise, the space required for cables such as the interconnection, electrical current cables and the information system connection to the printer must be anticipated. 3. Avoid installing equipment which produces elevated \nmagnetic fi  elds or vibrations like centrifuges, electrical \nmotors, compressors and generators in its vicinity. 4. Avoid locating it directly under the air-conditioning \nsystem (air currents) and sunlight. 5. An electrical outlet which complies with the current \nelectrical standards in the country or the laboratory. It must be in good condition and equipped with a ground pole and switches.Electronic balance operation\nThe operation of a modern electronic balance is clearly detailed in its operat or\u2019s manual from the manufacturer. In \ngeneral, it must conform to the following procedure:1. Allow the balance to equilibrate with the environment \nwhere it is installed. 2. Allow the balance to warm-up before initiating activities. Normally it is suffi   cient to have it connected to the \nelectrical feed system. Some manufacturers suggest at least 20 minutes from the moment it is energized until use. Analytical balances Class 1 require at least 2 hours for warming before initiating use. Verify that the balance is calibrated. Electronic \nbalances generally have a factory-made calibration stored in memory which can be used if it does not have calibration masses. If calibration is required, use calibrated masses as indicated by the manufacturer. The calibrated masses must conform or exceed the ASTM tolerances. For general information, the following table shows the accepted tolerance for the ASTM Class 1\n1 \nmasses. 3.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>An electrical supply source, which complies with the \ncountry\u2019s norms and standards.

Calibration of the microplate reader \nThe calibration of a microplate reader is a specialized process which must be ex ecuted by a technician or trained engineer \nfollowing the instructions provided by each manufacturer. In order to do the calibration, it is necessary to have a set of grey fi  lters mounted on a plate of equal geometric size \nto those used in the analyses. Manufacturers provide these calibration plates for any wavelength the equipment uses. Calibration plates are equipped with at least three pre-\nestablished optic density values within the measurement ranges; low, medium, and high value. In order to perform the calibration, follow this process:1.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>This type of rotor keeps tubes parallel to the rotational axis. Thus, separate bands are formed across the tube\u2019s diameter, not its length. These rotors are used for carrying out isopycnic studies and in some cases, zonal limit separations where a short centrifugation time is important. These rotors use specially designed tubes. Almost vertical tube rotors. This type of rotor is designed for gradient centrifugation \nwhen some sample components do not participate in the gradient.

Among other applications it confi  rms the \npresence of antibodies or antigens of an infectious agent in an organism, antibodies from a vaccine or auto-antibodies, for example in rheumatoid arthritis.OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThe microplate reader is a specialized spectrophotometer. Unlike the c onventional spectrophotometer which facilitates \nreadings on a wide range of wavelengths, the microplate reader has filters or diffraction gratings that limit the wavelength range to that used in ELISA, generally between 400 to 750 nm (nanometres). Some readers operate in the ultraviolet range and carry out analyses between 340 to 700 nm. The optical system exploited by many manufacturers uses optic fi  bres to supply light to the microplate wells \ncontaining the samples. The light beam, passing through the sample has a diameter ranging between 1 to 3 mm. A detection system detects the light coming from the sample, amplifi  es the signal and determines the sample\u2019s \nabsorbance. A reading system converts it into data allowing the test result interpretation. Some microplate readers use double beam light systems. Test samples are located in specially designed plates with \na specifi  c number of wells where the procedure or test is \ncarried out. Plates of 8 columns by 12 rows with a total of 96 wells are common. There are also plates with a greater number of wells. For specialized applications, the current trend is to increase the number of wells (384-well plates) to reduce the amount of reagents and samples used and a greater throughput. The location of the optical sensors of the microplate reader varies depending on the manufacturers: these can be located above the sample plate, or directly underneath the plate\u2019s wells. Nowadays microplate readers have controls regulated by \nmicroprocessors; connection interfaces to information systems; quality and process control programs, which by means of a computer, allow complete test automation.Chapter 1\nMicroplate Reader\nGMDN Code 37036\nECRI Code 16-979\nDenomination Photometric micro-plate reader\nPhoto courtesy of BioRad Laboratories CHAPTER 1  MICROPLATE READER\n2Equipment required for ELISA testing\nIn order to perform the ELISA technique, the following \nequipment is r equired:  \n1.

Microplate reader.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>The vacuum may be supplied by external and internal pumps. Extraction is done by a set of needles mounted on the washer\/dryer\u2019s head. The number of needles varies from one to three, according to the washer model used. If it uses only one needle, the washing and \nextraction operation is done with this single needle. If it uses two needles, one is used for supplying the washing solution and the other for extraction. If it uses three needles, the fi  rst is used for supplying the washing \nsolution, the second for extraction and the third for controlling (extracting) any excess volume in the well. Generally, the extraction needle is longer than the supply needle, which enables it to advance (vertically) up to a height ranging between 0.3 and 0.5 mm from the bottom of the well. \u2022\u2022 Advance sub-system. This is composed of a \nmechanism which moves the supply and extraction head horizontally to reach each well in the ELISA plate. When the horizontal movement to the following row occurs, there is a vertical movement towards the well to dispense or extract the washing solution. There are washers which carry out these operations in a simultaneous manner.The sub-systems previously described are shown in Figure \n2. Figure 3 shows the diff  erent types of wells most commonly \nfound in microplates. Each kind of well is suitable for a particular type of test. Washing process\nThe washing of the microplate is one of the stages of the ELISA t echnique. Special solutions are used in the washing \nsteps. Among those most commonly used is phosphate buff er solution or PBS. The phosphate buff  er solution has a \nstability of 2 months if kept at 4 \u00b0C. It is estimated that 1 to 3 litres of solution is required for washing one microplate and that 300 \u00b5l is used in each well per cycle. Washing can \nbe done manually, but it is preferable to use an automated microplate washer for a better throughput and to minimize handling of potentially contaminated substances. Among the washing processes used by microplate washers \nare featured:\n\u2022\u2022 Aspir ation from top to bottom. When the aspiration \nphase is initiated, the needles move vertically and the aspiration is initiated immediately as these enter into the liquid. The process continues until the needles reach their lowest position very close to the bottom of the wells. At this point they are stopped in order to avoid suctioning the air that should fl  ow against the \ninterior lateral walls of the wells. This type of aspiration prevents air currents from drying the bound protein on the surface of the wells.

Well pro\ufb01  les MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n9\u2022\u2022 Simultaneous distribution and aspiration. In certain \ntypes of washer, the washing and aspiration systems operate simultaneously, generating a controlled turbulence inside the well which removes the unbound substances during the incubations. \u2022\u2022 Aspir ation from the base of the wells. In this system, \nthe aspiration of the fluid contained in the wells is performed initially with the aspiration needles in a position very close to the bottom, immediately beginning a suctioning cycle, usually time-controlled. This system may aspirate air if there are diff  erences in \nthe levels of the tanks. Washer calibration\nThe microplate washer is critical for guaranteeing that the ELISA t echnique performs as expected. The alignment to \nbe taken into account for the eff  ective functioning of the \nequipment is presented next:\n\u2022\u2022 Position of the needles (supply and aspiration head). The horizontal and vertical position adjustment with respect to the wells must be verifi  ed carefully. If the \nplate has fl  at bottom wells, the supply needle must be \nchecked to see that it is situated very close to the well\u2019s wall. If the bottom is round or V-shaped, the suction needle should be located in the centre of the well: upon the vertical movement, a needle-base distance is maintained in the well, usually between 0.3 to 0.5 mm. The needles must never be allowed to touch the bottom of the wells to avoid mechanical interferences between the needle point and the well\u2019s base during the aspiration function. \u2022\u2022 Aspir ation time. Appropriately adjust the aspiration \ntime so that a solution fi  lm adhered to the well\u2019s wall \ncan fl  ow towards the bottom. Avoid very long time lapses to prevent the coating on the wells from drying up. Check that the suction system\u2019s needles are clean (free of obstructions). \u2022\u2022 Distributed V olume. Check that the volume distributed \nis as close as possible to the maximum capacity of the well; confi  rm that all the wells are fi  lled uniformly (at \nthe same level). Verify that the distributing needles are clean (free of obstructions). \u2022\u2022 Vacuum. The suctioning system must be calibrated \neffi  ciently. If the vacuum is too strong, the test can \nbe altered. In fact, it could dry out the wells and considerably weaken the enzyme activity in the wells and completely alter the test result. The majority of washers function with a vacuum ranging between 60 and 70% of atmospheric pressure. In some washers, the vacuum is made in an external pump which operates as an accessory of the washer. Its operation is controlled by the washer, which means that the vacuum pump operates only when required. Washing process veri\ufb01  cation \nTo verify that the washing process is done according to \nthe specifications of ELISA t echniques, manufacturers \nof ELISA tests have developed procedures to be carried out regularly. One of the controls\n1 is based on using the \nperoxidase reagent, which is dispensed using a pipette in the plate wells to be read at 405, 450 and 492 nm. At once the wells are washed and a colourless substrate is added (TMB\/H\n2O2\u2013Tetramethylbenzidine\/Hydrogen Peroxide). Whatever conjugate remains will hydrolyze the enzyme and the chromogen will change to blue. After stopping the reaction with acid, the TMB will turn yellow again. The resulting colour intensity is directly related to the washing process effi   ciency. INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS\nFor the microplate washer to operate correctly, the following \nis nec essary: \n1.

This information, along with good use and care, helps to maintain laboratory equipment in optimal condition.MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n1The microplate reader also known as \u201cPhotometric \nmicro-plate reader or ELISA reader\u201d is a specialized spectrophotometer designed to read results of the ELISA test, a technique used to determine the presence of antibodies or specifi  c antigens in samples. The technique \nis based on the detection of an antigen or antibodies captured on a solid surface using direct or secondary, labelled antibodies, producing a reaction whose product can be read by the spectrophotometer. The word ELISA is the acronym for \u201cEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay\u201d . This chapter covers the use of microplate readers for ELISA testing. For additional information on the instrument principles of operation and maintenance, consult Chapter 11 discussing the spectrophotometer. PHOTOGRAPH OF MICROPLATE READER\nPURPOSE OF THE MICROPLATE READER\nThe microplate reader is used for reading the results of ELISA \ntests. This technique has a direct application in immunology and serology. Among other applications it confi  rms the \npresence of antibodies or antigens of an infectious agent in an organism, antibodies from a vaccine or auto-antibodies, for example in rheumatoid arthritis.OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThe microplate reader is a specialized spectrophotometer. Unlike the c onventional spectrophotometer which facilitates \nreadings on a wide range of wavelengths, the microplate reader has filters or diffraction gratings that limit the wavelength range to that used in ELISA, generally between 400 to 750 nm (nanometres). Some readers operate in the ultraviolet range and carry out analyses between 340 to 700 nm. The optical system exploited by many manufacturers uses optic fi  bres to supply light to the microplate wells \ncontaining the samples. The light beam, passing through the sample has a diameter ranging between 1 to 3 mm. A detection system detects the light coming from the sample, amplifi  es the signal and determines the sample\u2019s \nabsorbance. A reading system converts it into data allowing the test result interpretation. Some microplate readers use double beam light systems. Test samples are located in specially designed plates with \na specifi  c number of wells where the procedure or test is \ncarried out. Plates of 8 columns by 12 rows with a total of 96 wells are common. There are also plates with a greater number of wells. For specialized applications, the current trend is to increase the number of wells (384-well plates) to reduce the amount of reagents and samples used and a greater throughput. The location of the optical sensors of the microplate reader varies depending on the manufacturers: these can be located above the sample plate, or directly underneath the plate\u2019s wells. Nowadays microplate readers have controls regulated by \nmicroprocessors; connection interfaces to information systems; quality and process control programs, which by means of a computer, allow complete test automation.Chapter 1\nMicroplate Reader\nGMDN Code 37036\nECRI Code 16-979\nDenomination Photometric micro-plate reader\nPhoto courtesy of BioRad Laboratories CHAPTER 1  MICROPLATE READER\n2Equipment required for ELISA testing\nIn order to perform the ELISA technique, the following \nequipment is r equired:  \n1.

The reference electrode is usually made of the same type of material as the internal electrode. Both tubes, interior and exterior, contain a reference solution. Only the outer tube has contact with the measured solution through a porous cap which acts as a saline bridge. This device acts like a galvanized cell. The reference electrode \nis the internal tube of the pH meter probe, which cannot lose ions through interactions with the surrounding environment. Therefore as a reference, it remains static (unchangeable) during the measuring process. The external tube of the probe contains the medium which is allowed  to mix with the external environment. As a result, this tube must be fi lled periodically with a potassium chloride solution (KCI) \nfor restoring the capacity of the electrode which would otherwise be inhibited by a loss of ions and evaporation. The glass bulb on the lower part of the pH electrode acts \nas a measuring element and is covered with a layer of hydrated gel on its exterior and interior. Metallic sodium cations [Na\n+] are diff  used in the hydrated gel outside of \nthe glass and in the solution, while the hydrogen ions [H+] \nare diff  used in the gel. This gel makes the pH electrode \nion-selective:  Hydrogen ions [H+] cannot pass through the \nglass membrane of the pH electrode. Sodium ions [Na+] pass \nthrough and cause a change in free energy, which the pH meter measures. A brief explanation of the theory on how electrodes function is included in the appendix at the end of the chapter.pH METER COMPONENTS \nA pH meter generally has the following components: 1. The body of the instrument containing the circuits, \ncontrols, connectors, display screens and measuring scales. The following are among some of its most \nimportant components:\na) An ON and OFF switch. Not all pH meters have an \non and off   switch. Some simply have a cord with a \nplug which allows it to be connected to a suitable electrical outlet. b) Temperature control. This control allows \nadjustments according to the temperature of the solution measured. c) Calibration controls. Depending on the design, \npH meters possess one or two calibration buttons or dials. Normally these are identifi  ed by Cal 1  and \nCal 2 . If the pH meter is calibrated using only one \nsolution, the Cal 1 button is used; making sure that Cal 2 is set at a 100%. If the pH meter allows  two point calibrations, two known pH solutions covering the range of pH to be measured are used. In this case, the two controls are used (Cal 1 and Cal 2). In special cases, a three-point calibration must be done (using three known pH solutions). d) Mode selector.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>2. Air velocity on entering the cabinet 50.8 cm\/s. 3.

The water distiller, also called distillation unit or water still, used in the laboratory, purifi  es running water by means of controlled \nvaporization and cooling processes. Upon applying thermal energy to water in a liquid phase by a warming process, it is changed into vapour. This allows the water molecules to separate from the molecules of other substances mixed or diluted. The water vapour is collected and passed through a condenser, where it is cooled and returned to the liquid phase. Then, the condensed water is collected into a diff  erent storage tank. Distilled water shows pure \ncharacteristics compared to running water; it is practically free of contaminating substances.PURPOSE OF THE WATER DISTILLER\nThe water distiller facilitates obtaining very pure water from potable wat er normally provided by the aqueduct services \nin urban centres. Distilled water is characterized by a lack of solids in suspension. It is used in multiple applications in centres which provide health services, especially in laboratory units, in washing, sterilization and dietetics. The more specialized the procedures are in the laboratory, the greater will be the level of purity required. For example: the preparation of reagents or biological material requires water of the highest quality. Distillation is one of the fundamental processes to achieve this (although it may not be the only one required). Water used in laboratories must be free of pyrogens, with a concentration of total solids no greater than 1 ppm, a pH value between 5.4 and 7.2 and an electrical resistance of at least 3 x 10\n5 ohm\/cm at 25 \u00b0C1. 1 Warming cabinets, sterilizers, and associated equipment , Division 11\u2013 \nEquipment, USACE\/NAVFAC\/ AFCESA, UFGS-11710, July 2003.

Functioning of the water distiller\nThe water distiller reproduces the natural phenomenon described abo ve. The configuration and design vary \ndepending on the volume of water required. The following is a general explanation of the components of a distiller and a description of how these function. 1. Vapour generator. Also known as the boiling tank, \nthis component is the container where the water to be distilled is stored. In general, it has a hydraulic connection which allows the water evaporated and distilled to be replenished. It is generally made of glass in small distillers or of stainless steel with copper, tin or titanium coverings in large capacity machines. It can have level, fl  ow and water quality feed controls, which \nprotect the distiller in case some irregularity in the water supply occurs. As a source of energy, it uses the water vapour coming from a boiler or vapour generator, or the thermal energy from electrical immersion resistors through direct conduction. These cause the water temperature to rise until, in normal conditions (atmospheric pressure equal to an atmosphere and gravity acceleration equal to 9.80665 m\/s\n2) water in the \nliquid phase is transformed into vapour at 100 \u00b0C. 2.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Specifi  es the type of rotor for which the \ntechnical information is being provided. 2.

The water distiller, also called distillation unit or water still, used in the laboratory, purifi  es running water by means of controlled \nvaporization and cooling processes. Upon applying thermal energy to water in a liquid phase by a warming process, it is changed into vapour. This allows the water molecules to separate from the molecules of other substances mixed or diluted. The water vapour is collected and passed through a condenser, where it is cooled and returned to the liquid phase. Then, the condensed water is collected into a diff  erent storage tank. Distilled water shows pure \ncharacteristics compared to running water; it is practically free of contaminating substances.PURPOSE OF THE WATER DISTILLER\nThe water distiller facilitates obtaining very pure water from potable wat er normally provided by the aqueduct services \nin urban centres. Distilled water is characterized by a lack of solids in suspension. It is used in multiple applications in centres which provide health services, especially in laboratory units, in washing, sterilization and dietetics. The more specialized the procedures are in the laboratory, the greater will be the level of purity required. For example: the preparation of reagents or biological material requires water of the highest quality. Distillation is one of the fundamental processes to achieve this (although it may not be the only one required). Water used in laboratories must be free of pyrogens, with a concentration of total solids no greater than 1 ppm, a pH value between 5.4 and 7.2 and an electrical resistance of at least 3 x 10\n5 ohm\/cm at 25 \u00b0C1. 1 Warming cabinets, sterilizers, and associated equipment , Division 11\u2013 \nEquipment, USACE\/NAVFAC\/ AFCESA, UFGS-11710, July 2003.

Its purpose is to give a better \nunderstanding of the technical requirements regarding installation, use and maintenance of various types of equipment which play an important role in performing diagnostic testing. The manual also aims to provide support to personnel responsible for technical management, implementation of quality management and maintenance. Due to the diversity of origins, brands and models, this manual off  ers general recommendations. Equipment-specifi  c details \nare explained in depth in the maintenance and installation user manuals from manufacturers. These should be requested and ordered through the procurement processes of the individual agencies and professionals responsible for the acquisition of technology, or directly from the manufacturer. This manual was originally developed by the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) to support improved quality \nprogrammes which PAHO promotes in regional laboratories. The English version was produced by WHO to further expand support for quality programmes in other regions. The revised edition now includes 20 equipment groups selected to cover those most commonly used in low to medium technical complexity laboratories across the world. Given the diff  erences in \ntechnical complexity, brands and existing models, each chapter has been developed with basic equipment in mind, including new technology where relevant. The following information is included in each chapter: \n\u2022\u2022 Groups of equipment, organized by their generic names.

The microplate washer performs the washing of the ELISA plate\u2019s wells during the diff  erent stages of the technique. PHOTOGRAPH OF MICROPLATE WASHER \nPURPOSE OF THE MICROPLATE WASHER \nThe microplate washer has been designed to supply cleaning \nbuff ers required for the ELISA technique in a controlled \nmanner. In the same fashion, the equipment removes from each well, substances in excess from the reaction. Depending on the test performed, the washer can intervene from one to four times, supplying the washing buff  er, agitating and \nremoving the unbound reagents\n1 until the programmed \ntimes and cycles are completed. The washer has of two reservoirs; one for the washing buff  er, the other for the waste \ngenerated during the washing process.OPERATION PRINCIPLES \nThe microplate washer has been designed to perform washing operations in the ELISA t echnique. The equipment \npossesses at least, the following subsystems which vary depending on the manufacturer\u2019s design. \u2022\u2022 Control subsystem. Generally , the washer is controlled \nby microprocessors allowing programming and controlling steps to be performed by the washer such as: number of washing cycles\n2 (1\u20135); expected times; \nsupplying and extracting pressures; plate format (96\u2013384 wells); suction function adjustment according to the type of well\n3 (fl at bottom, V bottom or rounded \nbottom or strips used); volumes distributed or aspirated; the soaking and agitation cycles, etc. \u2022\u2022 Supply subsystem. In general, this comprises a reservoir \nfor the washing solution; one or several pumps; usually a positive displacement type syringe and a dispenser head that supplies the washing solution to the diff  erent \nwells by means of needles. The head usually comes with eight pairs of needles for washing and aspirating simultaneously the wells of the same row (the supply and extraction sub-systems converge on the head). There are models with twelve pairs of needles and others that conduct the washing process simultaneously in all the wells. Some washers off  er the possibility of working \nwith diff  erent types of washing solutions, performing \nthe solution changes according to the program entered by the operator. 1 See a brief explication of the ELISA technique in Chapter 1, Microplate \nReader . 2 The exact number of washing operations required depends on the assay \nused.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>3.

This enables the meter to read the pH of the calibration solution. For example: For a solution at pH = 7, the needle can oscillate slightly in units of 0.1 pH; on average, the reading should be 7. The reading of the meter (reading scale) should be done perpendicularly, to avoid or eliminate parallel-type errors (reading errors produced by the shadow of the meter\u2019s needle, visible on the mirror of the reading scale). The pH meter is then ready (calibrated), to carry out the correct pH readings.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Part No. (Depending \non the \nmanufacturer)Model \n(Depending \non the \nmanufacturer)Syringe size Range \n(Processed \nvolume) Duct size1\nAqueous \nsolution  Viscous liquids\nDM DM 25 \u00b5l 2.5\u201325 \u00b5l  18 18\nDM DM 50 \u00b5l 5\u201350 \u00b5l 18 18DM DM 100 \u00b5l 10\u2013100 \u00b5l 18 18DM DM 250 \u00b5l 25\u2013250 \u00b5l 18 18DM DM 500 \u00b5l 50\u2013500 \u00b5l 18 18DM DM 1 ml 100\u20131 000 \u00b5l 18 18DM DM 2.5 ml 250\u20132 500 \u00b5l 18 12DM DM 5 ml 500\u20135 000 \u00b5l 12 12DM DM 10 ml 1 000\u201310 000 \u00b5l 12 12DM DM 25 ml 2 500\u201325 000 \u00b5l 12 12Table of syringe size\/volumes managed  \n1 Table 2.4, Microlab 501A, 503A, 504A, User\u2019s Manual , Hamilton Company.

The technique \nis based on the detection of an antigen or antibodies captured on a solid surface using direct or secondary, labelled antibodies, producing a reaction whose product can be read by the spectrophotometer. The word ELISA is the acronym for \u201cEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay\u201d . This chapter covers the use of microplate readers for ELISA testing. For additional information on the instrument principles of operation and maintenance, consult Chapter 11 discussing the spectrophotometer. PHOTOGRAPH OF MICROPLATE READER\nPURPOSE OF THE MICROPLATE READER\nThe microplate reader is used for reading the results of ELISA \ntests. This technique has a direct application in immunology and serology. Among other applications it confi  rms the \npresence of antibodies or antigens of an infectious agent in an organism, antibodies from a vaccine or auto-antibodies, for example in rheumatoid arthritis.OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThe microplate reader is a specialized spectrophotometer. Unlike the c onventional spectrophotometer which facilitates \nreadings on a wide range of wavelengths, the microplate reader has filters or diffraction gratings that limit the wavelength range to that used in ELISA, generally between 400 to 750 nm (nanometres). Some readers operate in the ultraviolet range and carry out analyses between 340 to 700 nm. The optical system exploited by many manufacturers uses optic fi  bres to supply light to the microplate wells \ncontaining the samples. The light beam, passing through the sample has a diameter ranging between 1 to 3 mm. A detection system detects the light coming from the sample, amplifi  es the signal and determines the sample\u2019s \nabsorbance. A reading system converts it into data allowing the test result interpretation. Some microplate readers use double beam light systems. Test samples are located in specially designed plates with \na specifi  c number of wells where the procedure or test is \ncarried out. Plates of 8 columns by 12 rows with a total of 96 wells are common. There are also plates with a greater number of wells. For specialized applications, the current trend is to increase the number of wells (384-well plates) to reduce the amount of reagents and samples used and a greater throughput. The location of the optical sensors of the microplate reader varies depending on the manufacturers: these can be located above the sample plate, or directly underneath the plate\u2019s wells. Nowadays microplate readers have controls regulated by \nmicroprocessors; connection interfaces to information systems; quality and process control programs, which by means of a computer, allow complete test automation.Chapter 1\nMicroplate Reader\nGMDN Code 37036\nECRI Code 16-979\nDenomination Photometric micro-plate reader\nPhoto courtesy of BioRad Laboratories CHAPTER 1  MICROPLATE READER\n2Equipment required for ELISA testing\nIn order to perform the ELISA technique, the following \nequipment is r equired:  \n1.

A set of reagents used for verifying the quality of washing done on the wells used i n the ELISA technique.MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n13Chapter 3\npH Meter\nThe pH meter is used for determining the concentration of \nhydrogen ions [H+] in a solution. This equipment, provided \nit is carefully used and calibrated, measures the acidity of an aqueous solution. pH meters are sometimes called pH analysers, pH monitors or potentiometers. PURPOSE OF THE EQUIPMENT\nThe pH meter is commonly used in any fi  eld of science \nrelated to aqueous solutions. It is used in areas such as agriculture, water treatment and purifi  cation, in industrial \nprocesses such as petrochemicals, paper manufacture, foods, pharmaceuticals, research and development, metal mechanics, etc. In the health laboratory, its applications are related to the control of culture mediums and to the measurement of the alkalinity or acidity of broths and buff ers. In specialized laboratories, diagnostic equipment \nmicroelectrodes are used to measure the pH of liquid blood components. The plasma pH allows the patient\u2019s health to be evaluated. It normally measures between 7.35 and 7.45. This value relates to the patient\u2019s metabolism in which a multitude of reactions occurs where acids and bases are normally kept in balance. Acids constantly liberate hydrogen ions [H\n+] and the organism neutralizes or balances \nacidity by liberating bicarbonate ions [HCO3\u2013]. The acid-base \nratio in the organism is maintained by the kidneys, (organs in which any excesses present are eliminated). The plasma pH is one of the characteristics that vary with factors such as age or state of health of the patient. Table 1 shows typical pH values of some bodily fl  uids.PHOTOGRAPH AND COMPONENTS OF THE \npH METER\nOPERA TION PRINCIPLES\nThe pH meter measures the concentration of hydrogen ions \n[H+] using an ion-sensitive electrode. Under ideal conditions, \nthis electrode should respond in the presence of only one type of ion.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Diff using tray. Device located at the bottom of the water bath to support the containers located inside the tank. It also allows thermal conve ction currents generated \nin the fl  uid contained in the tank to circulate from top to bottom and back to the top, maintaining the temperature homogeneous  at the level selected by the operator. In general the diff  using tray is made of stainless steel. Electrostatic painting. A painting process that uses the particle-attracting property of electrostatic charges. A potential diff  erence of 80-150kV is applied to a \ngrid of wires through which the paint is sprayed to charge each particle. The metal objects to be sprayed are connected to the opposite terminal of the high-voltage \ncircuit, so that they attract the particles of paint. The piece covered with paint particles is then placed in an electrical ov en to melt the particles, making them adhere \nstrongly to the piece. Fuse. A safety device which protects the electrical circuits from excessive current. Fuses are made of materials whose dimensions an d properties equip them to \nwork well within some predefi  ned conditions. If for some reason the design parameters are exceeded, the material burns out and interrupts the passage of the \nelectrical current. Immersion resistor . An electrical resistor (see defi  nition below) inside of a sealed tube. These are generally used for heating fl  uids as water o r oil. Resistance. Opposition that a material or electrical circuit imposes to the fl  ow of electric current. It is the property of a circuit that  transforms electrical energy \ninto heat as it opposes the fl  ow of current. The resistance [R], of a body of uniform section such as a wire, is directly propo rtional to the length [l] and inversely \nproportional to the sectional area [a]. The resistance is calculated by the following equation:\nR=k\u00d7l\na\nWhere: \nk  = constant that depends on the units employed \nl  = Length of the conductor a  = sectional area of the conductor \nThe ohm (\u03a9) is the common unit of electrical resistance; one ohm is equal to one volt per ampere.MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n35Chapter 6\nBiological Safety Cabinet\nThis equipment is designed for controlling aerosols and \nmicroparticles associated with managing potentially toxic or infectious biological material in laboratories in activities such as agitation, centrifugation, pipetting, and opening of pressurized containers.

Verify that the tip of the syringe does not touch the inside of the electrode. 5. Close the electrode with its cover. Rinse the electrode \nin distilled water. 6. Keep the electrode in storage buff  er solution while not \nin use. Cleaning of the electrode\nThe type of cleaning required for electrodes depends of the t ype of contaminant aff  ecting it. The most common \nprocedures are summarized next:1.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Before moving the cabinet to a diff  erent location. 5. After a spill of a material containing high risk agents. The most suitable decontamination procedure must be \ndefined by the professional responsible for industrial safety and professional risks. In annex G of the NSF 49 Standard, the procedure for decontaminating the cabinet using depolymerised paraformaldehyde is described. Only professionals who have received the relevant training must conduct such procedures.ROUTINE MAINTENANCE\nWarning:  The maintenance of internal components must \nonly be done by trained and qualifi  ed personnel. In order \nto carry out maintenance on the internal components, decontamination must be done previously. Personal protection must be worn to perform the routines. General maintenance required for the biological safety \ncabinet is for the most part simple to perform. The routines and frequencies are shown below:Frequency: Weekly1. Decontaminate the work surface and the interior \nsurfaces of the cabinet with 70% ethanol. 2. Clean the front glass door and the surface of the \nultraviolet lamp, using a domestic cleaning solution. 3. Verify the precision of the manometer\u2019s reading, \nindicating any fall in pressure fl  owing through the HEPA \nfi lter.

Turn the functions selector from Standby position to \npH position. 3.1 T his action connects the electrode to the pH \nmeasuring scale in the pH meter. 3.2 Adjust the meter to read the pH of the calibration \nsolution using the button marked Cal 1. This enables the meter to read the pH of the calibration solution. For example: For a solution at pH = 7, the needle can oscillate slightly in units of 0.1 pH; on average, the reading should be 7. The reading of the meter (reading scale) should be done perpendicularly, to avoid or eliminate parallel-type errors (reading errors produced by the shadow of the meter\u2019s needle, visible on the mirror of the reading scale).

It must be taken into account that the weight is the force which the gravitational fi  eld exercises on a body\u2019s mass, this force being the product of the mass \nby the local acceleration of gravity [F = m x g]. The term local is used to emphasize that this acceleration depends on factors such as the geographical latitude, altitude and the Earth\u2019s density where the measurement is taken. This force is measured in Newtons.

In the laboratory, the balance is used \nfor weighing as part of quality control activities (on devices like pipettes), in the preparation of mixtures of components in predefined proportions and in the determination of specifi  c densities or weights. OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThere are diff  erences in design, principles and criteria of \nmetrology amongst balances. At present, there are two large groups of balances: mechanical and electronic balances. Mechanical balances \nThe following are some of the more common ones: 1. Spring balance. Its function is based on a mechanical \nproperty of springs as the force exercised on a spring is proportional to the spring\u2019s elasticity constant [k], multiplied by its elongation [x] [F = -kx]. The greater the mass [m] placed on the balance\u2019s plate, the greater the elongation will be, given that the elongation is proportional to the mass and the spring\u2019s constant. The calibration of a spring balance depends on the force of gravity acting on the object weighed. This type of balance is used when great precision is not necessary. 2. Sliding weight balance. This type of balance is \nequipped with two known weights which can be moved on setting scales (one macro, the other micro). Upon placing a substance of unknown mass on the tray, its weight is determined by moving the weight on both setting scales until the equilibrium position is reached. At this point, the weight is obtained by adding both quantities indicated by the sliding masses\u2019 position on the scale. 3. Analytical balance. This balance functions by comparing \nknown weight masses with that of a substance of unknown weight. It is composed of a base on a bar or symmetrical lever, maintained by a blade-like support on a central point called a fulcrum. At its ends, there are stirrups, also supported with blades which allow these to oscillate smoothly. From there, two plates are suspended. Certifi  ed weights are placed on one \nof the plates and unknown weights on the other. The balance has a securing system or lock, which allows the main lever to remain stable when not in use or when it is necessary to modify the counter-weights. The balance is inside an external box which protects it from interferences, such as air currents. Analytical balances can weigh ten thousandths of a gram (0.0001 g) or 100 thousandths of a gram (0.00001 g). This type of balance generally has a capacity of up to 200 grams.

Analytical balance  MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n23It is necessary to have a set of certifi  ed masses. The set is \ngenerally composed of the following pieces:\n4. Upper plate balance (Top loading or parallel guidance \nbalance). This type of balance has a loading plate located \non its upper part, supported by a column maintained in a vertical position by two pairs of guides with fl  exible \nconnections. The eff  ect of the force produced by the \nmass is transmitted from a point on the vertical column directly or by some mechanical means to the loading cell. The requirement with this type of mechanism is that parallel guides must be maintained with exactitude of up to \u00b1 1  \u00b5m. Deviations in parallelism cause an error known \nas lateral load (when the mass being weighed shows diff erences if the reading is taken at the centre of the \nplate or on one of its sides). The diagram shown below explains the operation principle some manufacturers have introduced in electronic balances.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Store. Quality control\nThe quality control of dilutors is similar to that of pipettes. In order to resolve uncertainties, please see the explanation \nregarding how calibration is conducted in Chapter 16 on pipettes.MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n63TROUBLESHOOTING TABLE\nPROBLEM PROBABLE CAUSE SOLUTION\nThe dilutor does not turn on. There is a fault in the electrical feed.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>This vapour is concentrated in clouds. When atmospheric conditions are suitable, these cool and condense the water which returns to the surface of the Earth in the form of rain. Functioning of the water distiller\nThe water distiller reproduces the natural phenomenon described abo ve. The configuration and design vary \ndepending on the volume of water required. The following is a general explanation of the components of a distiller and a description of how these function. 1. Vapour generator. Also known as the boiling tank, \nthis component is the container where the water to be distilled is stored. In general, it has a hydraulic connection which allows the water evaporated and distilled to be replenished. It is generally made of glass in small distillers or of stainless steel with copper, tin or titanium coverings in large capacity machines. It can have level, fl  ow and water quality feed controls, which \nprotect the distiller in case some irregularity in the water supply occurs. As a source of energy, it uses the water vapour coming from a boiler or vapour generator, or the thermal energy from electrical immersion resistors through direct conduction. These cause the water temperature to rise until, in normal conditions (atmospheric pressure equal to an atmosphere and gravity acceleration equal to 9.80665 m\/s\n2) water in the \nliquid phase is transformed into vapour at 100 \u00b0C. 2.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Put the functions selector in the Standby \nposition. 4.<\/DOCUMENT>\n1.

Its purpose is to give a better \nunderstanding of the technical requirements regarding installation, use and maintenance of various types of equipment which play an important role in performing diagnostic testing. The manual also aims to provide support to personnel responsible for technical management, implementation of quality management and maintenance. Due to the diversity of origins, brands and models, this manual off  ers general recommendations. Equipment-specifi  c details \nare explained in depth in the maintenance and installation user manuals from manufacturers. These should be requested and ordered through the procurement processes of the individual agencies and professionals responsible for the acquisition of technology, or directly from the manufacturer. This manual was originally developed by the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) to support improved quality \nprogrammes which PAHO promotes in regional laboratories. The English version was produced by WHO to further expand support for quality programmes in other regions. The revised edition now includes 20 equipment groups selected to cover those most commonly used in low to medium technical complexity laboratories across the world. Given the diff  erences in \ntechnical complexity, brands and existing models, each chapter has been developed with basic equipment in mind, including new technology where relevant. The following information is included in each chapter: \n\u2022\u2022 Groups of equipment, organized by their generic names. Alternative names have also been included. \u2022\u2022 Photographs or diagrams, or a combination of both t o identify the type of equipment under consideration. \u2022\u2022 A brief explanation on the main uses or applications of the equipment in the laboratory. \u2022\u2022 A basic description of the principles by which the equipment operates with explanations of principles or physical and\/or \nchemical la ws which the interested reader can \u2013 or should study in depth. \u2022\u2022 Installation requirements with emphasis on the electrical aspects and the r equirements for safe installation and operation, \nincluding worldwide electrical standards. \u2022\u2022 Basic routine maintenance, classifi  ed according to the required frequency (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually \nor sporadically). The procedures are numbered and presented in the actual sequence in which these should take place (model-specifi  c procedures can be found in the manuals published by the manufacturers). \u2022\u2022 Troubleshooting tables with the most frequent problems aff  ecting the equipment with possible causes and actions that \nmay resolve these problems. \u2022\u2022 A list of basic defi  nitions of some of the specialized terms used.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Diff using tray. Device located at the bottom of the water bath to support the containers located inside the tank. It also allows thermal conve ction currents generated \nin the fl  uid contained in the tank to circulate from top to bottom and back to the top, maintaining the temperature homogeneous  at the level selected by the operator. In general the diff  using tray is made of stainless steel. Electrostatic painting. A painting process that uses the particle-attracting property of electrostatic charges. A potential diff  erence of 80-150kV is applied to a \ngrid of wires through which the paint is sprayed to charge each particle. The metal objects to be sprayed are connected to the opposite terminal of the high-voltage \ncircuit, so that they attract the particles of paint. The piece covered with paint particles is then placed in an electrical ov en to melt the particles, making them adhere \nstrongly to the piece. Fuse. A safety device which protects the electrical circuits from excessive current. Fuses are made of materials whose dimensions an d properties equip them to \nwork well within some predefi  ned conditions. If for some reason the design parameters are exceeded, the material burns out and interrupts the passage of the \nelectrical current. Immersion resistor . An electrical resistor (see defi  nition below) inside of a sealed tube. These are generally used for heating fl  uids as water o r oil. Resistance. Opposition that a material or electrical circuit imposes to the fl  ow of electric current. It is the property of a circuit that  transforms electrical energy \ninto heat as it opposes the fl  ow of current. The resistance [R], of a body of uniform section such as a wire, is directly propo rtional to the length [l] and inversely \nproportional to the sectional area [a]. The resistance is calculated by the following equation:\nR=k\u00d7l\na\nWhere: \nk  = constant that depends on the units employed \nl  = Length of the conductor a  = sectional area of the conductor \nThe ohm (\u03a9) is the common unit of electrical resistance; one ohm is equal to one volt per ampere.MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n35Chapter 6\nBiological Safety Cabinet\nThis equipment is designed for controlling aerosols and \nmicroparticles associated with managing potentially toxic or infectious biological material in laboratories in activities such as agitation, centrifugation, pipetting, and opening of pressurized containers. Safety cabinets have been designed to protect the user, the environment and the sample manipulated using appropriate ventilation conditions.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>3. Turn the functions selector from Standby position to \npH position. 3.1 T his action connects the electrode to the pH \nmeasuring scale in the pH meter. 3.2 Adjust the meter to read the pH of the calibration \nsolution using the button marked Cal 1. This enables the meter to read the pH of the calibration solution. For example: For a solution at pH = 7, the needle can oscillate slightly in units of 0.1 pH; on average, the reading should be 7. The reading of the meter (reading scale) should be done perpendicularly, to avoid or eliminate parallel-type errors (reading errors produced by the shadow of the meter\u2019s needle, visible on the mirror of the reading scale). The pH meter is then ready (calibrated), to carry out the correct pH readings.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Verify the state of gaskets and watertight joints. Frequency: Annually\n1.<\/DOCUMENT>\n2.

Dilutor controls    MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n61\nDispenser system\nThe dispenser system is composed of a set of high precision \nsyringes and devic es called dispensers, through which \nfl uids are supplied according to their volumes and selected \nvelocities. These syringes are selected and installed in the dilutor depending on the densities, viscosities, and volumes of fluids to be manipulated. The fluids are transported through flexible tubes, whose diameters, lengths and chemical compatibility are taken into account in the design and manufacturing process for suitability with the selected activity. These tubes are linked using connections manually adjustable. Normally, the syringes are classifi  ed according to \ntheir use (e.g. syringes for reagents, diluents, samples), and the volume these manipulate. The following table shows an example of how they are classifi  ed according to their size \nand managed volumes. Opposite, the components of the dispensing system (syringe \nand dispenser) are shown. INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS\nThe dilutor must be installed on a clean, dry and extremely levelled counter or work surface, far from areas where there \nmay be vapours which can aff  ect its functioning. There must be free space around the equipment for \nfacilitating ventilation and the passage of cables and interconnection lines and cables with the solvent containers, computers or supply systems. The space around the dilutor should be approximately 10 cm. There must be a 115 V, 60 Hz electrical outlet in good \ncondition with a ground pole or alternatively one of 220\u2013240 V, 50\/60 Hz, depending on the manufacturer\u2019s specifi  cations \nand\/or the electrical norms in the country of use.ROUTINE MAINTENANCE \nThe routine maintenance focuses mainly on eliminating contaminants which may accumulate inside the fluid \nmechanisms and\/or lines. The most common routines are the following:\nCleaning of exterior surfaces\nFrequency: Daily\nWarning:  Disconnect the dilutor from the electrical feed \noutlet before beginning the external cleaning process. 1.

OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nWater baths are made of steel and are generally c overed with electrostatic paint \nwith high adherence and resistance to environmental laboratory conditions. Water baths have an external panel on which the controls can be found. They also have a tank made of rustproof material with a collection of electrical resistors mounted on their lower part. By means of these, heat is transferred to the medium (water or oil) until reaching the temperature selected with a control device (thermostat or similar). The resistors may be of the following types:\u2022 Immersion type. These resistors are installed inside \na sealed tube and located on the lower part of the container in direct contact with heating medium. \u2022\u2022 External. These resistors are located on the lower part \nbut on the outside of the tank. These are protected by an isolating material which prevents heat loss. This type of resistor transfers the heat to the bottom of the tank through thermal conduction. The water bath is an instrument used in the laboratory for\n \u2022\n\u2022\nImmersion type. These resistors are installed iGMDN Code 36754 16772\nECRI Code 15-108 16-772\nDenomination Water bath Water bath, shaker\nFigure 16.

Immersion and external resistors    CHAPTER 5  WATER BATHS\n32Certain types of water bath have a series of accessories such \nas agitation systems or circulators, generating carefully controlled movement of the heating medium to keep the temperature uniform. A table which describes the main types of water baths is shown below. WATER BATH CONTROLS\nWater baths generally have very simple controls. Some manufacturers have incorporated controls with \nmicroprocessors. They vary depending on the type of bath. The diagram of a basic water bath\u2019s control panel is shown next. The control panel has these elements:\n1. The on and off   control switch\n2. A Menu button for selecting the operation\u2019s parameters: \noperation temperature, alarm temperature, temperature scale (\u00b0C, \u00b0F)\n3. Two buttons for parameter adjustment4. A screen 5. A pilot light6. Pilots (2) for identifying the temperature scale (\u00b0C, \u00b0F). WATER BATH OPERATION\nInstallation\n1. Install the water bath close to an electrical outlet. The \noutlet must ha ve its respective ground pole in order \nto guarantee the protection and safety of the operator and the equipment. Water baths generally operate at 120 V\/60 Hz or 230 V\/60Hz. Its installation and use is facilitated by a sink close by for supplying and draining of water. 2. Verify that the location selected is levelled and has the \nnecessary resistance to safely support the weight of the water bath when it is full of liquid. 3. Ensure that the location has a suitable amount of space \nfor putting the samples and the accessories required for the normal operation of the water bath. 4. Avoid placing the water bath where there are strong air \ncurrents which can interfere with its normal operation. For example: in front of an air-conditioning unit or window. Safety\n1. Avoid the use of the water bath in environments where \nther e are fl  ammable and combustible materials. The \nequipment has components (resistors generating very high temperatures) which could start an accidental fi  re \nor explosion. 2. Always connect the equipment to an electrical outlet \nwith a ground pole to protect the user and the equipment from electrical discharges. The electrical connection must comply with the required norms of the country and the laboratory. 3. Use the water bath exclusively with non-corrosive or \nnon-fl  ammable liquids. 4. Use personal protective elements when working with \nthe water bath. The bath has resistors which can cause burns if inadvertently touched, even a considerable time after turning off   the equipment. 5. When working with substances that generate vapours, \nplace the water bath under a chemical hood or in a well ventilated area. 6. Remember that liquids incubated in the water bath tank \ncan produce burns if hands are inadvertently placed inside it. 7. Take into account that the water bath is designed for \nuse with a liquid inside the tank. If the inside is dry, the temperature of the tank can become very high. Use the diff  using tray for placing the container inside of the \nfi lled tank of the water bath. This has been designed for \ndistributing the temperature in a uniform way. 8. Avoid using the water bath if any of its controls is not \nworking, e.g. the temperature or limit controls.Class Temperature range \nLow temperature  Room temperature up to 60 \u00b0C \nRoom temperature up to 100 \u00b0C\nHigh temperature Room temperature up to 275 \u00b0C. When it needs to \nreach temperatures above 100 \u00b0C, it is necessary to use fl  uids other than water as the boiling point of water is 100 \u00b0C under normal conditions\nThis type of bath generally uses oils which have much \nhigher boiling points. Insulated Room temperature up to 100 \u00b0C with accessories and\/\nor agitation systems (with water).<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>A timer.4.

MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n41Changing of the ultraviolet lamp\nIn order to change the ultraviolet lamp, the manufacturers\u2019 \ninstruc tions must be followed. In general, the following \nprocedures are done:1.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>On the outside and end of the inner tube is the anodized end. The reference electrode is usually made of the same type of material as the internal electrode. Both tubes, interior and exterior, contain a reference solution. Only the outer tube has contact with the measured solution through a porous cap which acts as a saline bridge. This device acts like a galvanized cell. The reference electrode \nis the internal tube of the pH meter probe, which cannot lose ions through interactions with the surrounding environment. Therefore as a reference, it remains static (unchangeable) during the measuring process. The external tube of the probe contains the medium which is allowed  to mix with the external environment. As a result, this tube must be fi lled periodically with a potassium chloride solution (KCI) \nfor restoring the capacity of the electrode which would otherwise be inhibited by a loss of ions and evaporation. The glass bulb on the lower part of the pH electrode acts \nas a measuring element and is covered with a layer of hydrated gel on its exterior and interior. Metallic sodium cations [Na\n+] are diff  used in the hydrated gel outside of \nthe glass and in the solution, while the hydrogen ions [H+] \nare diff  used in the gel. This gel makes the pH electrode \nion-selective:  Hydrogen ions [H+] cannot pass through the \nglass membrane of the pH electrode. Sodium ions [Na+] pass \nthrough and cause a change in free energy, which the pH meter measures. A brief explanation of the theory on how electrodes function is included in the appendix at the end of the chapter.pH METER COMPONENTS \nA pH meter generally has the following components: 1. The body of the instrument containing the circuits, \ncontrols, connectors, display screens and measuring scales. The following are among some of its most \nimportant components:\na) An ON and OFF switch. Not all pH meters have an \non and off   switch. Some simply have a cord with a \nplug which allows it to be connected to a suitable electrical outlet. b) Temperature control. This control allows \nadjustments according to the temperature of the solution measured. c) Calibration controls. Depending on the design, \npH meters possess one or two calibration buttons or dials. Normally these are identifi  ed by Cal 1  and \nCal 2 . If the pH meter is calibrated using only one \nsolution, the Cal 1 button is used; making sure that Cal 2 is set at a 100%. If the pH meter allows  two point calibrations, two known pH solutions covering the range of pH to be measured are used. In this case, the two controls are used (Cal 1 and Cal 2). In special cases, a three-point calibration must be done (using three known pH solutions). d) Mode selector.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Particles from a suspension settling at the bottom of the liquid as a result of the action of the gravitational force.

The water distiller, also called distillation unit or water still, used in the laboratory, purifi  es running water by means of controlled \nvaporization and cooling processes. Upon applying thermal energy to water in a liquid phase by a warming process, it is changed into vapour. This allows the water molecules to separate from the molecules of other substances mixed or diluted. The water vapour is collected and passed through a condenser, where it is cooled and returned to the liquid phase. Then, the condensed water is collected into a diff  erent storage tank. Distilled water shows pure \ncharacteristics compared to running water; it is practically free of contaminating substances.PURPOSE OF THE WATER DISTILLER\nThe water distiller facilitates obtaining very pure water from potable wat er normally provided by the aqueduct services \nin urban centres. Distilled water is characterized by a lack of solids in suspension. It is used in multiple applications in centres which provide health services, especially in laboratory units, in washing, sterilization and dietetics. The more specialized the procedures are in the laboratory, the greater will be the level of purity required. For example: the preparation of reagents or biological material requires water of the highest quality. Distillation is one of the fundamental processes to achieve this (although it may not be the only one required). Water used in laboratories must be free of pyrogens, with a concentration of total solids no greater than 1 ppm, a pH value between 5.4 and 7.2 and an electrical resistance of at least 3 x 10\n5 ohm\/cm at 25 \u00b0C1. 1 Warming cabinets, sterilizers, and associated equipment , Division 11\u2013 \nEquipment, USACE\/NAVFAC\/ AFCESA, UFGS-11710, July 2003.

Its purpose is to give a better \nunderstanding of the technical requirements regarding installation, use and maintenance of various types of equipment which play an important role in performing diagnostic testing. The manual also aims to provide support to personnel responsible for technical management, implementation of quality management and maintenance. Due to the diversity of origins, brands and models, this manual off  ers general recommendations. Equipment-specifi  c details \nare explained in depth in the maintenance and installation user manuals from manufacturers. These should be requested and ordered through the procurement processes of the individual agencies and professionals responsible for the acquisition of technology, or directly from the manufacturer. This manual was originally developed by the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) to support improved quality \nprogrammes which PAHO promotes in regional laboratories. The English version was produced by WHO to further expand support for quality programmes in other regions. The revised edition now includes 20 equipment groups selected to cover those most commonly used in low to medium technical complexity laboratories across the world. Given the diff  erences in \ntechnical complexity, brands and existing models, each chapter has been developed with basic equipment in mind, including new technology where relevant. The following information is included in each chapter: \n\u2022\u2022 Groups of equipment, organized by their generic names. Alternative names have also been included. \u2022\u2022 Photographs or diagrams, or a combination of both t o identify the type of equipment under consideration. \u2022\u2022 A brief explanation on the main uses or applications of the equipment in the laboratory. \u2022\u2022 A basic description of the principles by which the equipment operates with explanations of principles or physical and\/or \nchemical la ws which the interested reader can \u2013 or should study in depth. \u2022\u2022 Installation requirements with emphasis on the electrical aspects and the r equirements for safe installation and operation, \nincluding worldwide electrical standards. \u2022\u2022 Basic routine maintenance, classifi  ed according to the required frequency (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually \nor sporadically). The procedures are numbered and presented in the actual sequence in which these should take place (model-specifi  c procedures can be found in the manuals published by the manufacturers). \u2022\u2022 Troubleshooting tables with the most frequent problems aff  ecting the equipment with possible causes and actions that \nmay resolve these problems. \u2022\u2022 A list of basic defi  nitions of some of the specialized terms used.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Traceability.

The assistant is helpful, clever, friendly and gives concise and accurate answers.","role":"system"},{"content":"<DOCUMENT>On the outside and end of the inner tube is the anodized end. The reference electrode is usually made of the same type of material as the internal electrode. Both tubes, interior and exterior, contain a reference solution. Only the outer tube has contact with the measured solution through a porous cap which acts as a saline bridge. This device acts like a galvanized cell. The reference electrode \nis the internal tube of the pH meter probe, which cannot lose ions through interactions with the surrounding environment. Therefore as a reference, it remains static (unchangeable) during the measuring process. The external tube of the probe contains the medium which is allowed  to mix with the external environment. As a result, this tube must be fi lled periodically with a potassium chloride solution (KCI) \nfor restoring the capacity of the electrode which would otherwise be inhibited by a loss of ions and evaporation. The glass bulb on the lower part of the pH electrode acts \nas a measuring element and is covered with a layer of hydrated gel on its exterior and interior. Metallic sodium cations [Na\n+] are diff  used in the hydrated gel outside of \nthe glass and in the solution, while the hydrogen ions [H+] \nare diff  used in the gel. This gel makes the pH electrode \nion-selective:  Hydrogen ions [H+] cannot pass through the \nglass membrane of the pH electrode. Sodium ions [Na+] pass \nthrough and cause a change in free energy, which the pH meter measures. A brief explanation of the theory on how electrodes function is included in the appendix at the end of the chapter.pH METER COMPONENTS \nA pH meter generally has the following components: 1. The body of the instrument containing the circuits, \ncontrols, connectors, display screens and measuring scales. The following are among some of its most \nimportant components:\na) An ON and OFF switch. Not all pH meters have an \non and off   switch. Some simply have a cord with a \nplug which allows it to be connected to a suitable electrical outlet. b) Temperature control. This control allows \nadjustments according to the temperature of the solution measured. c) Calibration controls. Depending on the design, \npH meters possess one or two calibration buttons or dials. Normally these are identifi  ed by Cal 1  and \nCal 2 . If the pH meter is calibrated using only one \nsolution, the Cal 1 button is used; making sure that Cal 2 is set at a 100%. If the pH meter allows  two point calibrations, two known pH solutions covering the range of pH to be measured are used. In this case, the two controls are used (Cal 1 and Cal 2). In special cases, a three-point calibration must be done (using three known pH solutions). d) Mode selector.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Information on the compatibility of the rotor with other \nmodels of centrifuges from the same manufacturer. Recently manufactured centrifuges have incorporated \nnumerous improvements into their design to provide greater safety and longer operational life. Among advances mentioned are controls based on microprocessors. By means of software  controlled by a keyboard, these have several \ndiff erent operational programs in memory. According to the \ntype of rotor being used and procedure conducted, these programs control the centrifugation time, the required temperature, the rotor\u2019s revolutions, the acceleration and deceleration, alarms warning the operator about any anomaly during operation. Manufacturers have also incorporated induction motors \n(without brushes) in centrifuges. These have the advantage of electronically controlling currents and magnetic fields regulating the rotor\u2019s speed which reduces the frequency of maintenance. Operation and maintenance of such equipment must be carried out according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS\nCentrifuges require the following for normal operation:1. An electrical connection with a capacity suitable for the \nequipment providing stable single phase or triphase type voltage (depending on the model and specifi  cation \ngiven by the manufacturer). In general, centrifuges use 110V or 220 V\/60 Hz. 2.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Verify the cleanliness of the covers and their adjustments. 2. Test the connection cable and its system of connections. Check that they are in good condition and clean. 3. Examine the equipment controls. Verify that these are \nin good condition and activated without diffi   culty. 4. Verify that the meter is in good condition. To do this, the \ninstrument must be disconnected from the electric feed line. Adjust the indicator needle to zero (0) using the adjustment screw generally found below the pivot of the indicator needle. If the equipment has an indicator screen, check that it is functioning normally.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Initiate activities. Slowly introduce hands into the work \narea.

Try to perform the most risky and contaminating activities towards the back of the cabinet\u2019s work area. Avoid the use of open fl  ames of lighters since this breaks the laminar \nfl ow pattern and may burn the fi  lter. Avoid removing \nhands from the work area until all procedures are accomplished and the potentially dangerous materials are disposed of in the biosafety bag or in the pipette and sharp containers. 6. Clean the cabinet, allowing the air to fl  ow freely for 3 to \n5 minutes upon ending all the procedures. 7. Decontaminate the surfaces of all the materials \nand equipment in contact with the biologically contaminated material. Apply 70% ethanol or a suitable disinfectant and allow drying. Lift the equipment and materials and disinfect the area underneath. Cover the open containers before removal from the work area. Transfer materials to their appropriate place (incubator, autoclave, etc.). 8. Discard the gloves and remove personal protective \nelements. Dispose of these following the laboratory\u2019s established procedure. Wash hands with a lot of water and soap.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>The temperature range at which water baths are normally used range between room temperature and 60 \u00b0C.

A balance\u2019s ability to consistently read the value of masses, no matter where they are placed on the weighing scale. This is a lso called corner load. Lateral load error. A deviation in the results when an object is weighed placing it in diff  erent parts of the weighing plate, i.e. in the centre o f the plate and on \none of its sides. Linear error.

A graph showing  weight compared to the \nweight indication on a perfectly linear balance should generate a straight line. In order to determine the linear error of a ba lance, certifi  ed masses must be used.

A process through which a fl  uid in liquid phase is heated until converted into vapour and then cooled and condensed back into liquid phase. The \ndistillation process is used for separating mixed substances, taking advantage of their diff  erence in volatility. To obtain ver y pure substances, consecutive distillation \ncycles are performed with the aim of progressively eliminating other substances present in the mix. Hardness (of water). A chemical characteristic of water determined by the carbonate, bicarbonate, chlorine, sulphate and occasionally calcium nitra te and \nmagnesium content. The resulting resistance is undesirable in some processes. There are two types of resistors in water. \u2022 Temporary hardness. This is determined by the magnesium and calcium carbonate and bicarbonate content. It may be eliminated by boiling the water a nd \nsubsequently fi  ltering out the precipitate. It is also known as carbonate resistance. \u2022 Permanent hardness. This is determined by all the calcium and magnesium salts, except the carbonates and bicarbonates. It cannot be eliminated by the \nboiling of water and it is also known as non-bicarbonate resistance.

Solution. A homogenous mix of two or more substances characterized by the absence of chemical reactions between the components of the li quid mixture. The \nliquid component which generally appears in greater proportion is called the solvent  and that found in a lesser quantity in solution, the solute .MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n59Chapter 9\nDilutor\nThe dilutor is used for diluting substances. Dilute comes \nfrom the Latin word diluere  and means to add liquid to a \nsolution. Solutions are defi  ned as homogeneous mixtures \nof two or more components which may be gaseous, liquid or solid. To dilute is to reduce the strength of a fl uid in a solvent, generally water. The dilutor facilitates \nthe preparation of liquid mixtures, until these achieve a proportion (concentration) suitable for use in different diagnostic processes. The identification of this type of equipment is generalized using the word dilutor. DIAGRAM OF A DILUTORPURPOSE OF THE DILUTOR\nThe purpose of the dilutor is to prepare mixtures of \nsubstanc es to achieve determined concentrations and \nvolumes as done with a pipette, but with the advantage of an automated or programmed process. Dilutors vary in size and complexity.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Remove the cover of the boiling tank.3.

Verify if there are diff  erences in the readings obtained \nfrom well to well. If this is the case, invert the plate (180\u00b0) and repeat the reading to rule out that diff  erences are \nattributed to the plate itself. In general, it is accepted that the instrument does not need further calibration if the plate results are as expected at two wavelengths. 3. Verify if the reader requires calibration. If so, proceed \nwith the calibration following the routine outlined by the manufacturer, verifying that the reading\u2019s linearity is maintained as rigorously as possible. 4. If the instrument does not have a calibration plate, verify \nit by placing a coloured solution in the wells of a plate and immediately carry out a complete reading. Then invert the plate 180\u00b0 and read the plate again. If both readings display identical, average values in each row, the reader is calibrated. 5. Verify that the reader is calibrated, column by column. Place a clean, empty plate and carry out a reading. If there is no diff  erence between each of the average \nreading of the fi  rst to the last column, it can be assumed \nthat the reader is calibrated.

Samples, controls and standards are added to the wells \nand incubated at temperatures ranging between room temperature and 37 \u00b0C for a determined period of time, according to the test\u2019s characteristics. During the incubation, the sample\u2019s antigen binds to the antibody coated to the plate; or the antibody in the sample binds to the antigen coated on the plate, according to their presence and quantity in the sample analyzed. 3. After incubation, the unbound antigen or antibodies are \nwashed and removed from the plate by the microplate washer using an appropriate washing buff  er. 4. Next, a secondary antibody, called the conjugate, is \nadded. This harbours an enzyme which will react with a substrate to produce a change of colour at a later step. 5. Then begins a second period of incubation during \nwhich this conjugate will bind to the antigen-antibody complex in the wells. 6. After the incubation, a new washing cycle is done to \nremove unbound conjugate from the wells. 7.<\/DOCUMENT>\n3. What should be verified about the electrode carrying arm?

Its purpose is to give a better \nunderstanding of the technical requirements regarding installation, use and maintenance of various types of equipment which play an important role in performing diagnostic testing. The manual also aims to provide support to personnel responsible for technical management, implementation of quality management and maintenance. Due to the diversity of origins, brands and models, this manual off  ers general recommendations. Equipment-specifi  c details \nare explained in depth in the maintenance and installation user manuals from manufacturers. These should be requested and ordered through the procurement processes of the individual agencies and professionals responsible for the acquisition of technology, or directly from the manufacturer. This manual was originally developed by the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) to support improved quality \nprogrammes which PAHO promotes in regional laboratories. The English version was produced by WHO to further expand support for quality programmes in other regions. The revised edition now includes 20 equipment groups selected to cover those most commonly used in low to medium technical complexity laboratories across the world. Given the diff  erences in \ntechnical complexity, brands and existing models, each chapter has been developed with basic equipment in mind, including new technology where relevant.

INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS \nDepending on the design, capacity and type of distiller, \nthe r equired installation may vary. The most common \nrequirements are the following:1. A well ventilated environment in which the equipment \ncan be installed. This is necessary because the distiller transfers heat to a fl  uid and increases the temperature \nof the area where it is installed. It is necessary to leave free space around the distiller so that the fl  ow of air is \nfacilitated.

Use titanium rotors if working with saline solutions \nfrequently. 8. Protect the rotors\u2019 coating in order to avoid the metal \nbase from deteriorating. Do not use alkaline detergents or cleaning solutions which can remove the protective fi lm. The rotors generally made of aluminium [Al] are \ncovered by a fi  lm of anodized aluminium which protects \ntheir metal structure. 9. Use plastic brushes when cleaning the rotor. Metal \nbrushes scratch the protective coating and generate sources for future corrosion. Corrosion is accelerated in operation conditions and shortens the rotor\u2019s operational life. 10. If there are spills of corrosive substances, wash the rotor \nimmediately. 11. Air dry the rotor once cleaned and washed with water.12. Store vertical tube rotors and almost vertical tube rotors \nwith the larger side facing downwards and without their covers. 13. Store rotors in a dry area. Avoid leaving them in the \ncentrifuge. 14. Store swinging buckets rotors without the compartments\u2019 \ncovers. 15.

Never try to open the cover of a centrifuge while it is \nfunctioning and never try to stop the rotor by hand. Tubes \nTube care includes aspects such as fi  lling of the tubes, adequat e temperature selection, centrifugation speed \nlimitations, washing and sterilization. The principle recommendations are the following:1. Wash tubes, adaptors and other accessories by hand \nusing a 1:10 mild detergent solution in water and a soft textured brush (not metallic). Avoid using automatic dishwashers. 2. Avoid using alcohol and acetone since such liquids aff  ect \nthe structure of the tubes. Manufacturers recommend the solvent to be used with each type of centrifugation tube material. 3. Avoid drying tubes in a drying oven. Dry always with a \nstream of hot air.4. Verify if the tubes are reusable or not. If they are \ndisposable, use them only once. 5. For sterilizing, it is necessary to verify the material from \nwhich the tube is made, as not all can stand sterilization by heat. Glass tubes are normally sterilized with vapour at 121 \u00b0C for 30 minutes. 6. Store tubes and bottles in a dark, fresh, dry place, \nfar from chemical vapours or ultraviolet radiation sources. 7. Verify maximum fi  lling levels and the sealing of thin \nwall tubes in order to avoid collapse inside the rotor by the action of the centrifugal force. Comply with manufacturers recommendations. Preventive maintenance\nWarning:  Nev er carry out a technical intervention in a \ncentrifuge if it has not been previously decontaminated. The most important maintenance routines performed on a \ncentrifuge are the following:Frequency: Monthly1. Verify that the centrifuge external components are free \nof dust and stains. Avoid aff  ecting the rotor with spills. Clean the rotor compartment using a mild detergent. 2. Test that the rotors\u2019 connecting and adjustment \nmechanisms are in good condition. Keep the points lubricated as the manufacturer recommends. 3. Verify the locking \/safety mechanism of the centrifuge\u2019s \ncover.

Tubes \nTube care includes aspects such as fi  lling of the tubes, adequat e temperature selection, centrifugation speed \nlimitations, washing and sterilization. The principle recommendations are the following:1. Wash tubes, adaptors and other accessories by hand \nusing a 1:10 mild detergent solution in water and a soft textured brush (not metallic). Avoid using automatic dishwashers. 2. Avoid using alcohol and acetone since such liquids aff  ect \nthe structure of the tubes. Manufacturers recommend the solvent to be used with each type of centrifugation tube material. 3. Avoid drying tubes in a drying oven. Dry always with a \nstream of hot air.4. Verify if the tubes are reusable or not. If they are \ndisposable, use them only once. 5. For sterilizing, it is necessary to verify the material from \nwhich the tube is made, as not all can stand sterilization by heat. Glass tubes are normally sterilized with vapour at 121 \u00b0C for 30 minutes. 6. Store tubes and bottles in a dark, fresh, dry place, \nfar from chemical vapours or ultraviolet radiation sources. 7.

These syringes are selected and installed in the dilutor depending on the densities, viscosities, and volumes of fluids to be manipulated. The fluids are transported through flexible tubes, whose diameters, lengths and chemical compatibility are taken into account in the design and manufacturing process for suitability with the selected activity. These tubes are linked using connections manually adjustable. Normally, the syringes are classifi  ed according to \ntheir use (e.g. syringes for reagents, diluents, samples), and the volume these manipulate. The following table shows an example of how they are classifi  ed according to their size \nand managed volumes. Opposite, the components of the dispensing system (syringe \nand dispenser) are shown. INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS\nThe dilutor must be installed on a clean, dry and extremely levelled counter or work surface, far from areas where there \nmay be vapours which can aff  ect its functioning. There must be free space around the equipment for \nfacilitating ventilation and the passage of cables and interconnection lines and cables with the solvent containers, computers or supply systems. The space around the dilutor should be approximately 10 cm. There must be a 115 V, 60 Hz electrical outlet in good \ncondition with a ground pole or alternatively one of 220\u2013240 V, 50\/60 Hz, depending on the manufacturer\u2019s specifi  cations \nand\/or the electrical norms in the country of use.ROUTINE MAINTENANCE \nThe routine maintenance focuses mainly on eliminating contaminants which may accumulate inside the fluid \nmechanisms and\/or lines.

Measurement of the concentration of the hydrogen ion (H+) given in moles per litre (M) in a solution. The pH concept was proposed by S\u00f8rensen and Lindstr\u00f8m-\nLang in 1909 to facilitate expressing very low ion concentrations. It is defi  ned by the following equation:pH = \u2013log [H\n+]      or      [H+] = 10-pH \nIt measures the acidity of a solution. Example, in water the concentration of [H+] is 1.0 x 10-7 M resulting in pH = 7. This allows the range of concentrations from \n1 to 10-14 M, to be expressed from zero (0) to 14. There are diverse systems for measuring the acidity of a solution. An acidic substance  dissolved in water is capable \nof producing H+ ions. A basic substance dissolved in water is capable of producing [OH\u2013] (hydroxides) ions. An acid substance has a greater quantity of ions [H+] than pure water; a basic substance shows greater quantities of ions [OH\u2013] than pure water. The concentrations \nof substances are expressed in moles per litre. In pure water, the ion concentration [H+] and [OH\u2013] is 1.0 x 10\u20137 M, it is thus considered a neutral substance.

This equipment, provided \nit is carefully used and calibrated, measures the acidity of an aqueous solution. pH meters are sometimes called pH analysers, pH monitors or potentiometers. PURPOSE OF THE EQUIPMENT\nThe pH meter is commonly used in any fi  eld of science \nrelated to aqueous solutions. It is used in areas such as agriculture, water treatment and purifi  cation, in industrial \nprocesses such as petrochemicals, paper manufacture, foods, pharmaceuticals, research and development, metal mechanics, etc. In the health laboratory, its applications are related to the control of culture mediums and to the measurement of the alkalinity or acidity of broths and buff ers. In specialized laboratories, diagnostic equipment \nmicroelectrodes are used to measure the pH of liquid blood components. The plasma pH allows the patient\u2019s health to be evaluated. It normally measures between 7.35 and 7.45. This value relates to the patient\u2019s metabolism in which a multitude of reactions occurs where acids and bases are normally kept in balance. Acids constantly liberate hydrogen ions [H\n+] and the organism neutralizes or balances \nacidity by liberating bicarbonate ions [HCO3\u2013]. The acid-base \nratio in the organism is maintained by the kidneys, (organs in which any excesses present are eliminated). The plasma pH is one of the characteristics that vary with factors such as age or state of health of the patient. Table 1 shows typical pH values of some bodily fl  uids.PHOTOGRAPH AND COMPONENTS OF THE \npH METER\nOPERA TION PRINCIPLES\nThe pH meter measures the concentration of hydrogen ions \n[H+] using an ion-sensitive electrode.

A measuring device known as \u201cload cell\u201d produces an \nexit signal corresponding to the load\u2019s force in the form of changes in the voltage or frequency. 3. A digital analogous electronic circuit shows the fi  nal \nresult of the weight digitally. Laboratory balances operate according to the principle \nof compensation of the electromagnetic force applicable to displacements or torques. The combination of their mechanical components and automatic reading systems provides weight measurements at defi  ned levels of accuracy \ndepending on the model. Principle. The mobile parts (weighing plate, support \ncolumn [a], bobbin, position and load indicator [G] -the object in the process of being weighed-) are maintained in equilibrium by a compensation force [F] equal to the weight. The compensation force is generated by an electrical current through a bobbin in the air gap of a cylindrical electromagnet. The force F is calculated with the equation [F = I x L x B] where: I = electrical intensity, L = total length of the wire of the coil and B = magnetic fl  ow intensity in the \nelectromagnet\u2019s air gap.With any change in the load (weight\/mass), the mobile \nmechanical system responds by moving vertically a fraction of distance. Detected by a photosensor [e], an electrical signal is sent to the servo-amplifi  er [f]. This changes the \nfl ow of electrical current passing through the bobbin of the \nmagnet [c] in such a manner that the mobile system returns to the balanced position upon adjusting of the magnetic fl ow in the electromagnet. Consequently, the weight of \nthe mass [G] can be measured indirectly at the start of the electrical current fl  ow, which passes through the circuit \nmeasuring the voltage [V] by means of a precision resistor [R], [V = I x R]. To date, many systems developed use the electronic system for carrying out very exact measurements of mass and weight. The following diagram explains how electronic balances function.

If it uses three needles, the fi  rst is used for supplying the washing \nsolution, the second for extraction and the third for controlling (extracting) any excess volume in the well.

This is composed of a \nmechanism which moves the supply and extraction head horizontally to reach each well in the ELISA plate. When the horizontal movement to the following row occurs, there is a vertical movement towards the well to dispense or extract the washing solution. There are washers which carry out these operations in a simultaneous manner.The sub-systems previously described are shown in Figure \n2. Figure 3 shows the diff  erent types of wells most commonly \nfound in microplates. Each kind of well is suitable for a particular type of test. Washing process\nThe washing of the microplate is one of the stages of the ELISA t echnique. Special solutions are used in the washing \nsteps. Among those most commonly used is phosphate buff er solution or PBS. The phosphate buff  er solution has a \nstability of 2 months if kept at 4 \u00b0C. It is estimated that 1 to 3 litres of solution is required for washing one microplate and that 300 \u00b5l is used in each well per cycle.

Among the washing processes used by microplate washers \nare featured:\n\u2022\u2022 Aspir ation from top to bottom. When the aspiration \nphase is initiated, the needles move vertically and the aspiration is initiated immediately as these enter into the liquid. The process continues until the needles reach their lowest position very close to the bottom of the wells. At this point they are stopped in order to avoid suctioning the air that should fl  ow against the \ninterior lateral walls of the wells. This type of aspiration prevents air currents from drying the bound protein on the surface of the wells.

In certain \ntypes of washer, the washing and aspiration systems operate simultaneously, generating a controlled turbulence inside the well which removes the unbound substances during the incubations. \u2022\u2022 Aspir ation from the base of the wells. In this system, \nthe aspiration of the fluid contained in the wells is performed initially with the aspiration needles in a position very close to the bottom, immediately beginning a suctioning cycle, usually time-controlled. This system may aspirate air if there are diff  erences in \nthe levels of the tanks. Washer calibration\nThe microplate washer is critical for guaranteeing that the ELISA t echnique performs as expected. The alignment to \nbe taken into account for the eff  ective functioning of the \nequipment is presented next:\n\u2022\u2022 Position of the needles (supply and aspiration head). The horizontal and vertical position adjustment with respect to the wells must be verifi  ed carefully. If the \nplate has fl  at bottom wells, the supply needle must be \nchecked to see that it is situated very close to the well\u2019s wall. If the bottom is round or V-shaped, the suction needle should be located in the centre of the well: upon the vertical movement, a needle-base distance is maintained in the well, usually between 0.3 to 0.5 mm. The needles must never be allowed to touch the bottom of the wells to avoid mechanical interferences between the needle point and the well\u2019s base during the aspiration function. \u2022\u2022 Aspir ation time. Appropriately adjust the aspiration \ntime so that a solution fi  lm adhered to the well\u2019s wall \ncan fl  ow towards the bottom. Avoid very long time lapses to prevent the coating on the wells from drying up. Check that the suction system\u2019s needles are clean (free of obstructions). \u2022\u2022 Distributed V olume. Check that the volume distributed \nis as close as possible to the maximum capacity of the well; confi  rm that all the wells are fi  lled uniformly (at \nthe same level). Verify that the distributing needles are clean (free of obstructions). \u2022\u2022 Vacuum. The suctioning system must be calibrated \neffi  ciently. If the vacuum is too strong, the test can \nbe altered. In fact, it could dry out the wells and considerably weaken the enzyme activity in the wells and completely alter the test result. The majority of washers function with a vacuum ranging between 60 and 70% of atmospheric pressure. In some washers, the vacuum is made in an external pump which operates as an accessory of the washer. Its operation is controlled by the washer, which means that the vacuum pump operates only when required. Washing process veri\ufb01  cation \nTo verify that the washing process is done according to \nthe specifications of ELISA t echniques, manufacturers \nof ELISA tests have developed procedures to be carried out regularly. One of the controls\n1 is based on using the \nperoxidase reagent, which is dispensed using a pipette in the plate wells to be read at 405, 450 and 492 nm. At once the wells are washed and a colourless substrate is added (TMB\/H\n2O2\u2013Tetramethylbenzidine\/Hydrogen Peroxide). Whatever conjugate remains will hydrolyze the enzyme and the chromogen will change to blue. After stopping the reaction with acid, the TMB will turn yellow again. The resulting colour intensity is directly related to the washing process effi   ciency. INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS\nFor the microplate washer to operate correctly, the following \nis nec essary: \n1.

The principle recommendations are the following:1. Wash tubes, adaptors and other accessories by hand \nusing a 1:10 mild detergent solution in water and a soft textured brush (not metallic). Avoid using automatic dishwashers. 2. Avoid using alcohol and acetone since such liquids aff  ect \nthe structure of the tubes. Manufacturers recommend the solvent to be used with each type of centrifugation tube material. 3. Avoid drying tubes in a drying oven. Dry always with a \nstream of hot air.4. Verify if the tubes are reusable or not. If they are \ndisposable, use them only once. 5. For sterilizing, it is necessary to verify the material from \nwhich the tube is made, as not all can stand sterilization by heat. Glass tubes are normally sterilized with vapour at 121 \u00b0C for 30 minutes. 6. Store tubes and bottles in a dark, fresh, dry place, \nfar from chemical vapours or ultraviolet radiation sources. 7.

It must be taken into account that the weight is the force which the gravitational fi  eld exercises on a body\u2019s mass, this force being the product of the mass \nby the local acceleration of gravity [F = m x g]. The term local is used to emphasize that this acceleration depends on factors such as the geographical latitude, altitude and the Earth\u2019s density where the measurement is taken. This force is measured in Newtons.

In the laboratory, the balance is used \nfor weighing as part of quality control activities (on devices like pipettes), in the preparation of mixtures of components in predefined proportions and in the determination of specifi  c densities or weights. OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThere are diff  erences in design, principles and criteria of \nmetrology amongst balances. At present, there are two large groups of balances: mechanical and electronic balances. Mechanical balances \nThe following are some of the more common ones: 1. Spring balance. Its function is based on a mechanical \nproperty of springs as the force exercised on a spring is proportional to the spring\u2019s elasticity constant [k], multiplied by its elongation [x] [F = -kx]. The greater the mass [m] placed on the balance\u2019s plate, the greater the elongation will be, given that the elongation is proportional to the mass and the spring\u2019s constant. The calibration of a spring balance depends on the force of gravity acting on the object weighed. This type of balance is used when great precision is not necessary. 2. Sliding weight balance. This type of balance is \nequipped with two known weights which can be moved on setting scales (one macro, the other micro). Upon placing a substance of unknown mass on the tray, its weight is determined by moving the weight on both setting scales until the equilibrium position is reached. At this point, the weight is obtained by adding both quantities indicated by the sliding masses\u2019 position on the scale. 3. Analytical balance. This balance functions by comparing \nknown weight masses with that of a substance of unknown weight. It is composed of a base on a bar or symmetrical lever, maintained by a blade-like support on a central point called a fulcrum. At its ends, there are stirrups, also supported with blades which allow these to oscillate smoothly. From there, two plates are suspended. Certifi  ed weights are placed on one \nof the plates and unknown weights on the other. The balance has a securing system or lock, which allows the main lever to remain stable when not in use or when it is necessary to modify the counter-weights. The balance is inside an external box which protects it from interferences, such as air currents. Analytical balances can weigh ten thousandths of a gram (0.0001 g) or 100 thousandths of a gram (0.00001 g). This type of balance generally has a capacity of up to 200 grams.

Upper plate balance (Top loading or parallel guidance \nbalance). This type of balance has a loading plate located \non its upper part, supported by a column maintained in a vertical position by two pairs of guides with fl  exible \nconnections. The eff  ect of the force produced by the \nmass is transmitted from a point on the vertical column directly or by some mechanical means to the loading cell. The requirement with this type of mechanism is that parallel guides must be maintained with exactitude of up to \u00b1 1  \u00b5m. Deviations in parallelism cause an error known \nas lateral load (when the mass being weighed shows diff erences if the reading is taken at the centre of the \nplate or on one of its sides).

A process through which a fl  uid in liquid phase is heated until converted into vapour and then cooled and condensed back into liquid phase. The \ndistillation process is used for separating mixed substances, taking advantage of their diff  erence in volatility. To obtain ver y pure substances, consecutive distillation \ncycles are performed with the aim of progressively eliminating other substances present in the mix. Hardness (of water). A chemical characteristic of water determined by the carbonate, bicarbonate, chlorine, sulphate and occasionally calcium nitra te and \nmagnesium content. The resulting resistance is undesirable in some processes. There are two types of resistors in water. \u2022 Temporary hardness. This is determined by the magnesium and calcium carbonate and bicarbonate content. It may be eliminated by boiling the water a nd \nsubsequently fi  ltering out the precipitate. It is also known as carbonate resistance. \u2022 Permanent hardness. This is determined by all the calcium and magnesium salts, except the carbonates and bicarbonates. It cannot be eliminated by the \nboiling of water and it is also known as non-bicarbonate resistance.

Dilute comes \nfrom the Latin word diluere  and means to add liquid to a \nsolution. Solutions are defi  ned as homogeneous mixtures \nof two or more components which may be gaseous, liquid or solid. To dilute is to reduce the strength of a fl uid in a solvent, generally water. The dilutor facilitates \nthe preparation of liquid mixtures, until these achieve a proportion (concentration) suitable for use in different diagnostic processes. The identification of this type of equipment is generalized using the word dilutor.

OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nWater baths are made of steel and are generally c overed with electrostatic paint \nwith high adherence and resistance to environmental laboratory conditions. Water baths have an external panel on which the controls can be found. They also have a tank made of rustproof material with a collection of electrical resistors mounted on their lower part. By means of these, heat is transferred to the medium (water or oil) until reaching the temperature selected with a control device (thermostat or similar). The resistors may be of the following types:\u2022 Immersion type. These resistors are installed inside \na sealed tube and located on the lower part of the container in direct contact with heating medium. \u2022\u2022 External. These resistors are located on the lower part \nbut on the outside of the tank. These are protected by an isolating material which prevents heat loss. This type of resistor transfers the heat to the bottom of the tank through thermal conduction. The water bath is an instrument used in the laboratory for\n \u2022\n\u2022\nImmersion type.

A table which describes the main types of water baths is shown below. WATER BATH CONTROLS\nWater baths generally have very simple controls. Some manufacturers have incorporated controls with \nmicroprocessors. They vary depending on the type of bath. The diagram of a basic water bath\u2019s control panel is shown next. The control panel has these elements:\n1. The on and off   control switch\n2. A Menu button for selecting the operation\u2019s parameters: \noperation temperature, alarm temperature, temperature scale (\u00b0C, \u00b0F)\n3. Two buttons for parameter adjustment4. A screen 5. A pilot light6. Pilots (2) for identifying the temperature scale (\u00b0C, \u00b0F). WATER BATH OPERATION\nInstallation\n1. Install the water bath close to an electrical outlet. The \noutlet must ha ve its respective ground pole in order \nto guarantee the protection and safety of the operator and the equipment. Water baths generally operate at 120 V\/60 Hz or 230 V\/60Hz. Its installation and use is facilitated by a sink close by for supplying and draining of water. 2. Verify that the location selected is levelled and has the \nnecessary resistance to safely support the weight of the water bath when it is full of liquid. 3. Ensure that the location has a suitable amount of space \nfor putting the samples and the accessories required for the normal operation of the water bath. 4. Avoid placing the water bath where there are strong air \ncurrents which can interfere with its normal operation. For example: in front of an air-conditioning unit or window. Safety\n1. Avoid the use of the water bath in environments where \nther e are fl  ammable and combustible materials. The \nequipment has components (resistors generating very high temperatures) which could start an accidental fi  re \nor explosion. 2. Always connect the equipment to an electrical outlet \nwith a ground pole to protect the user and the equipment from electrical discharges. The electrical connection must comply with the required norms of the country and the laboratory. 3. Use the water bath exclusively with non-corrosive or \nnon-fl  ammable liquids. 4. Use personal protective elements when working with \nthe water bath. The bath has resistors which can cause burns if inadvertently touched, even a considerable time after turning off   the equipment. 5. When working with substances that generate vapours, \nplace the water bath under a chemical hood or in a well ventilated area. 6. Remember that liquids incubated in the water bath tank \ncan produce burns if hands are inadvertently placed inside it. 7. Take into account that the water bath is designed for \nuse with a liquid inside the tank. If the inside is dry, the temperature of the tank can become very high. Use the diff  using tray for placing the container inside of the \nfi lled tank of the water bath. This has been designed for \ndistributing the temperature in a uniform way. 8. Avoid using the water bath if any of its controls is not \nworking, e.g. the temperature or limit controls.Class Temperature range \nLow temperature  Room temperature up to 60 \u00b0C \nRoom temperature up to 100 \u00b0C\nHigh temperature Room temperature up to 275 \u00b0C.

Extraction is done by a set of needles mounted on the washer\/dryer\u2019s head. The number of needles varies from one to three, according to the washer model used. If it uses only one needle, the washing and \nextraction operation is done with this single needle. If it uses two needles, one is used for supplying the washing solution and the other for extraction. If it uses three needles, the fi  rst is used for supplying the washing \nsolution, the second for extraction and the third for controlling (extracting) any excess volume in the well. Generally, the extraction needle is longer than the supply needle, which enables it to advance (vertically) up to a height ranging between 0.3 and 0.5 mm from the bottom of the well. \u2022\u2022 Advance sub-system. This is composed of a \nmechanism which moves the supply and extraction head horizontally to reach each well in the ELISA plate. When the horizontal movement to the following row occurs, there is a vertical movement towards the well to dispense or extract the washing solution. There are washers which carry out these operations in a simultaneous manner.The sub-systems previously described are shown in Figure \n2. Figure 3 shows the diff  erent types of wells most commonly \nfound in microplates. Each kind of well is suitable for a particular type of test. Washing process\nThe washing of the microplate is one of the stages of the ELISA t echnique. Special solutions are used in the washing \nsteps. Among those most commonly used is phosphate buff er solution or PBS. The phosphate buff  er solution has a \nstability of 2 months if kept at 4 \u00b0C. It is estimated that 1 to 3 litres of solution is required for washing one microplate and that 300 \u00b5l is used in each well per cycle. Washing can \nbe done manually, but it is preferable to use an automated microplate washer for a better throughput and to minimize handling of potentially contaminated substances. Among the washing processes used by microplate washers \nare featured:\n\u2022\u2022 Aspir ation from top to bottom. When the aspiration \nphase is initiated, the needles move vertically and the aspiration is initiated immediately as these enter into the liquid. The process continues until the needles reach their lowest position very close to the bottom of the wells. At this point they are stopped in order to avoid suctioning the air that should fl  ow against the \ninterior lateral walls of the wells. This type of aspiration prevents air currents from drying the bound protein on the surface of the wells.

Well pro\ufb01  les MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n9\u2022\u2022 Simultaneous distribution and aspiration. In certain \ntypes of washer, the washing and aspiration systems operate simultaneously, generating a controlled turbulence inside the well which removes the unbound substances during the incubations. \u2022\u2022 Aspir ation from the base of the wells. In this system, \nthe aspiration of the fluid contained in the wells is performed initially with the aspiration needles in a position very close to the bottom, immediately beginning a suctioning cycle, usually time-controlled. This system may aspirate air if there are diff  erences in \nthe levels of the tanks. Washer calibration\nThe microplate washer is critical for guaranteeing that the ELISA t echnique performs as expected. The alignment to \nbe taken into account for the eff  ective functioning of the \nequipment is presented next:\n\u2022\u2022 Position of the needles (supply and aspiration head). The horizontal and vertical position adjustment with respect to the wells must be verifi  ed carefully. If the \nplate has fl  at bottom wells, the supply needle must be \nchecked to see that it is situated very close to the well\u2019s wall. If the bottom is round or V-shaped, the suction needle should be located in the centre of the well: upon the vertical movement, a needle-base distance is maintained in the well, usually between 0.3 to 0.5 mm. The needles must never be allowed to touch the bottom of the wells to avoid mechanical interferences between the needle point and the well\u2019s base during the aspiration function. \u2022\u2022 Aspir ation time. Appropriately adjust the aspiration \ntime so that a solution fi  lm adhered to the well\u2019s wall \ncan fl  ow towards the bottom. Avoid very long time lapses to prevent the coating on the wells from drying up. Check that the suction system\u2019s needles are clean (free of obstructions). \u2022\u2022 Distributed V olume. Check that the volume distributed \nis as close as possible to the maximum capacity of the well; confi  rm that all the wells are fi  lled uniformly (at \nthe same level). Verify that the distributing needles are clean (free of obstructions). \u2022\u2022 Vacuum. The suctioning system must be calibrated \neffi  ciently. If the vacuum is too strong, the test can \nbe altered. In fact, it could dry out the wells and considerably weaken the enzyme activity in the wells and completely alter the test result. The majority of washers function with a vacuum ranging between 60 and 70% of atmospheric pressure. In some washers, the vacuum is made in an external pump which operates as an accessory of the washer. Its operation is controlled by the washer, which means that the vacuum pump operates only when required. Washing process veri\ufb01  cation \nTo verify that the washing process is done according to \nthe specifications of ELISA t echniques, manufacturers \nof ELISA tests have developed procedures to be carried out regularly. One of the controls\n1 is based on using the \nperoxidase reagent, which is dispensed using a pipette in the plate wells to be read at 405, 450 and 492 nm. At once the wells are washed and a colourless substrate is added (TMB\/H\n2O2\u2013Tetramethylbenzidine\/Hydrogen Peroxide). Whatever conjugate remains will hydrolyze the enzyme and the chromogen will change to blue. After stopping the reaction with acid, the TMB will turn yellow again. The resulting colour intensity is directly related to the washing process effi   ciency. INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS\nFor the microplate washer to operate correctly, the following \nis nec essary: \n1.

Its purpose is to give a better \nunderstanding of the technical requirements regarding installation, use and maintenance of various types of equipment which play an important role in performing diagnostic testing. The manual also aims to provide support to personnel responsible for technical management, implementation of quality management and maintenance. Due to the diversity of origins, brands and models, this manual off  ers general recommendations. Equipment-specifi  c details \nare explained in depth in the maintenance and installation user manuals from manufacturers. These should be requested and ordered through the procurement processes of the individual agencies and professionals responsible for the acquisition of technology, or directly from the manufacturer. This manual was originally developed by the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) to support improved quality \nprogrammes which PAHO promotes in regional laboratories. The English version was produced by WHO to further expand support for quality programmes in other regions. The revised edition now includes 20 equipment groups selected to cover those most commonly used in low to medium technical complexity laboratories across the world. Given the diff  erences in \ntechnical complexity, brands and existing models, each chapter has been developed with basic equipment in mind, including new technology where relevant.

The following is a general explanation of the components of a distiller and a description of how these function. 1. Vapour generator. Also known as the boiling tank, \nthis component is the container where the water to be distilled is stored.

It can have level, fl  ow and water quality feed controls, which \nprotect the distiller in case some irregularity in the water supply occurs. As a source of energy, it uses the water vapour coming from a boiler or vapour generator, or the thermal energy from electrical immersion resistors through direct conduction.

It must be taken into account that the weight is the force which the gravitational fi  eld exercises on a body\u2019s mass, this force being the product of the mass \nby the local acceleration of gravity [F = m x g]. The term local is used to emphasize that this acceleration depends on factors such as the geographical latitude, altitude and the Earth\u2019s density where the measurement is taken. This force is measured in Newtons.

In the laboratory, the balance is used \nfor weighing as part of quality control activities (on devices like pipettes), in the preparation of mixtures of components in predefined proportions and in the determination of specifi  c densities or weights. OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThere are diff  erences in design, principles and criteria of \nmetrology amongst balances. At present, there are two large groups of balances: mechanical and electronic balances. Mechanical balances \nThe following are some of the more common ones: 1. Spring balance. Its function is based on a mechanical \nproperty of springs as the force exercised on a spring is proportional to the spring\u2019s elasticity constant [k], multiplied by its elongation [x] [F = -kx]. The greater the mass [m] placed on the balance\u2019s plate, the greater the elongation will be, given that the elongation is proportional to the mass and the spring\u2019s constant. The calibration of a spring balance depends on the force of gravity acting on the object weighed. This type of balance is used when great precision is not necessary. 2. Sliding weight balance. This type of balance is \nequipped with two known weights which can be moved on setting scales (one macro, the other micro). Upon placing a substance of unknown mass on the tray, its weight is determined by moving the weight on both setting scales until the equilibrium position is reached. At this point, the weight is obtained by adding both quantities indicated by the sliding masses\u2019 position on the scale. 3. Analytical balance. This balance functions by comparing \nknown weight masses with that of a substance of unknown weight. It is composed of a base on a bar or symmetrical lever, maintained by a blade-like support on a central point called a fulcrum. At its ends, there are stirrups, also supported with blades which allow these to oscillate smoothly. From there, two plates are suspended. Certifi  ed weights are placed on one \nof the plates and unknown weights on the other. The balance has a securing system or lock, which allows the main lever to remain stable when not in use or when it is necessary to modify the counter-weights. The balance is inside an external box which protects it from interferences, such as air currents. Analytical balances can weigh ten thousandths of a gram (0.0001 g) or 100 thousandths of a gram (0.00001 g). This type of balance generally has a capacity of up to 200 grams.

Analytical balance  MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n23It is necessary to have a set of certifi  ed masses. The set is \ngenerally composed of the following pieces:\n4. Upper plate balance (Top loading or parallel guidance \nbalance). This type of balance has a loading plate located \non its upper part, supported by a column maintained in a vertical position by two pairs of guides with fl  exible \nconnections. The eff  ect of the force produced by the \nmass is transmitted from a point on the vertical column directly or by some mechanical means to the loading cell. The requirement with this type of mechanism is that parallel guides must be maintained with exactitude of up to \u00b1 1  \u00b5m. Deviations in parallelism cause an error known \nas lateral load (when the mass being weighed shows diff erences if the reading is taken at the centre of the \nplate or on one of its sides).

A process through which a fl  uid in liquid phase is heated until converted into vapour and then cooled and condensed back into liquid phase. The \ndistillation process is used for separating mixed substances, taking advantage of their diff  erence in volatility. To obtain ver y pure substances, consecutive distillation \ncycles are performed with the aim of progressively eliminating other substances present in the mix. Hardness (of water). A chemical characteristic of water determined by the carbonate, bicarbonate, chlorine, sulphate and occasionally calcium nitra te and \nmagnesium content. The resulting resistance is undesirable in some processes. There are two types of resistors in water. \u2022 Temporary hardness. This is determined by the magnesium and calcium carbonate and bicarbonate content. It may be eliminated by boiling the water a nd \nsubsequently fi  ltering out the precipitate. It is also known as carbonate resistance. \u2022 Permanent hardness. This is determined by all the calcium and magnesium salts, except the carbonates and bicarbonates. It cannot be eliminated by the \nboiling of water and it is also known as non-bicarbonate resistance.

Solution. A homogenous mix of two or more substances characterized by the absence of chemical reactions between the components of the li quid mixture. The \nliquid component which generally appears in greater proportion is called the solvent  and that found in a lesser quantity in solution, the solute .MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n59Chapter 9\nDilutor\nThe dilutor is used for diluting substances. Dilute comes \nfrom the Latin word diluere  and means to add liquid to a \nsolution. Solutions are defi  ned as homogeneous mixtures \nof two or more components which may be gaseous, liquid or solid. To dilute is to reduce the strength of a fl uid in a solvent, generally water. The dilutor facilitates \nthe preparation of liquid mixtures, until these achieve a proportion (concentration) suitable for use in different diagnostic processes. The identification of this type of equipment is generalized using the word dilutor. DIAGRAM OF A DILUTORPURPOSE OF THE DILUTOR\nThe purpose of the dilutor is to prepare mixtures of \nsubstanc es to achieve determined concentrations and \nvolumes as done with a pipette, but with the advantage of an automated or programmed process.

This occurs in dilutors when using la rge capacity syringes with elevated \npropulsion speed. Concentration. A quantity measurement of a chemical substance present in a solution. The concept is expressed as the quantity of a substance dissolved into a \nsolvent. Concentration is expressed in diverse forms; the most common are: molarity [M], molality [m], normality [N], percentag e rate of solute. Dilution. To reduce the concentration of a solution by adding other fl  uids. The fl  uid added is known as the diluent . Adding the molecules of a liquid substance with \nthe molecules of another liquid substance.

Dilutor controls    MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n61\nDispenser system\nThe dispenser system is composed of a set of high precision \nsyringes and devic es called dispensers, through which \nfl uids are supplied according to their volumes and selected \nvelocities. These syringes are selected and installed in the dilutor depending on the densities, viscosities, and volumes of fluids to be manipulated. The fluids are transported through flexible tubes, whose diameters, lengths and chemical compatibility are taken into account in the design and manufacturing process for suitability with the selected activity. These tubes are linked using connections manually adjustable. Normally, the syringes are classifi  ed according to \ntheir use (e.g. syringes for reagents, diluents, samples), and the volume these manipulate. The following table shows an example of how they are classifi  ed according to their size \nand managed volumes. Opposite, the components of the dispensing system (syringe \nand dispenser) are shown. INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS\nThe dilutor must be installed on a clean, dry and extremely levelled counter or work surface, far from areas where there \nmay be vapours which can aff  ect its functioning. There must be free space around the equipment for \nfacilitating ventilation and the passage of cables and interconnection lines and cables with the solvent containers, computers or supply systems. The space around the dilutor should be approximately 10 cm. There must be a 115 V, 60 Hz electrical outlet in good \ncondition with a ground pole or alternatively one of 220\u2013240 V, 50\/60 Hz, depending on the manufacturer\u2019s specifi  cations \nand\/or the electrical norms in the country of use.ROUTINE MAINTENANCE \nThe routine maintenance focuses mainly on eliminating contaminants which may accumulate inside the fluid \nmechanisms and\/or lines. The most common routines are the following:\nCleaning of exterior surfaces\nFrequency: Daily\nWarning:  Disconnect the dilutor from the electrical feed \noutlet before beginning the external cleaning process. 1. Clean the exterior surfaces using a clean piece of cloth \ndampened with a mild detergent mixed with water. 2. Lightly rub the surfaces of the dilutor and the \naccessories. 3. Dry the treated surfaces. Warning:  Avoid humidity from entering the compartment \nof the electrical and electronic components.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Information on the compatibility of the rotor with other \nmodels of centrifuges from the same manufacturer. Recently manufactured centrifuges have incorporated \nnumerous improvements into their design to provide greater safety and longer operational life. Among advances mentioned are controls based on microprocessors. By means of software  controlled by a keyboard, these have several \ndiff erent operational programs in memory. According to the \ntype of rotor being used and procedure conducted, these programs control the centrifugation time, the required temperature, the rotor\u2019s revolutions, the acceleration and deceleration, alarms warning the operator about any anomaly during operation. Manufacturers have also incorporated induction motors \n(without brushes) in centrifuges.

In the laboratory, the balance is used \nfor weighing as part of quality control activities (on devices like pipettes), in the preparation of mixtures of components in predefined proportions and in the determination of specifi  c densities or weights. OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThere are diff  erences in design, principles and criteria of \nmetrology amongst balances. At present, there are two large groups of balances: mechanical and electronic balances. Mechanical balances \nThe following are some of the more common ones: 1. Spring balance. Its function is based on a mechanical \nproperty of springs as the force exercised on a spring is proportional to the spring\u2019s elasticity constant [k], multiplied by its elongation [x] [F = -kx]. The greater the mass [m] placed on the balance\u2019s plate, the greater the elongation will be, given that the elongation is proportional to the mass and the spring\u2019s constant. The calibration of a spring balance depends on the force of gravity acting on the object weighed. This type of balance is used when great precision is not necessary. 2. Sliding weight balance. This type of balance is \nequipped with two known weights which can be moved on setting scales (one macro, the other micro). Upon placing a substance of unknown mass on the tray, its weight is determined by moving the weight on both setting scales until the equilibrium position is reached. At this point, the weight is obtained by adding both quantities indicated by the sliding masses\u2019 position on the scale. 3. Analytical balance. This balance functions by comparing \nknown weight masses with that of a substance of unknown weight. It is composed of a base on a bar or symmetrical lever, maintained by a blade-like support on a central point called a fulcrum. At its ends, there are stirrups, also supported with blades which allow these to oscillate smoothly. From there, two plates are suspended. Certifi  ed weights are placed on one \nof the plates and unknown weights on the other. The balance has a securing system or lock, which allows the main lever to remain stable when not in use or when it is necessary to modify the counter-weights. The balance is inside an external box which protects it from interferences, such as air currents. Analytical balances can weigh ten thousandths of a gram (0.0001 g) or 100 thousandths of a gram (0.00001 g). This type of balance generally has a capacity of up to 200 grams.

Upper plate balance (Top loading or parallel guidance \nbalance). This type of balance has a loading plate located \non its upper part, supported by a column maintained in a vertical position by two pairs of guides with fl  exible \nconnections. The eff  ect of the force produced by the \nmass is transmitted from a point on the vertical column directly or by some mechanical means to the loading cell. The requirement with this type of mechanism is that parallel guides must be maintained with exactitude of up to \u00b1 1  \u00b5m. Deviations in parallelism cause an error known \nas lateral load (when the mass being weighed shows diff erences if the reading is taken at the centre of the \nplate or on one of its sides).

This is a balance with a single plate. An unknown mass is placed on the weighing plate. It is weighed by removing known masses from the counterweight side until it reaches a balanced position, using a mechanical system of cams. The fulcrum is generally off  -centre in relation to the length of the load \nbeam and located near the front of the balance. When a mass is placed on the weight plate and the balance\u2019s locking mechanism is released, the movement of the load beam is projected through an optical system to a screen located on the front part of the instrument. Operation veri\ufb01  cation\nThe procedure used for verifying the functioning of a typical \nmechanical balanc e is described below. The described \nprocess is based on the substitution balance.1. Verify that the balance is levelled. The levelling is \nachieved using a ring-shaped adjustment mechanism located on the base of the balance or by adjusting a bubble or knob on a scale located on the front of the balance\u2019s base. 2. Test the  zero mechanism. Place the controls on zero \nand free the balance. If the reading does not stay at zero, adjust the zero mechanism (a grooved screw located in a horizontal position near the fulcrum). To do this, it is necessary to block the balance and slightly adjust the mechanism. The process is to be continued until the zero adjusts correctly on the reading scale.3. Verify and adjust the sensitivity. This is always readjusted \nwhenever some internal adjustment is done. It is performed with a known standard according to the following steps:\na) Lock the balance.b) Place a standard weight (equivalent to the optical \nscale range) on the plate. c) Position the micro setting to one (1). d) Release the balance. e) Adjust to the zero position.f) Position the micro setting to zero (0). The balance \nshould indicate 100. If the scale displays less or more than 100, the sensitivity control must be adjusted. This requires locking the balance, opening the upper cover and turning the sensitivity screw: If the scale registers more than 100; turn the screw in a clockwise position. If the scale registers less than 100, it is necessary to unwind the screw anticlockwise. Repeat the process until the balance is adjusted (adjusting the zero and the sensitivity).Type of mass Capacity\nSimple pieces \n 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 g \n100, 200 and 500 g \nFractional pieces \n 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 mg \n100, 200 and 500 mg \nMass\nPlate\nFlexible\nConnections\nSupport ColumnFGFigure 10.

A platform of high \ninertia, isolated from the structures located in its vicinity is ideal to reduce the eff  ect of vibrations from certain \nequipment such as centrifuges and refrigerators. There must be a large enough area for installing the balance and any auxiliary equipment needed during the weighing processes. Likewise, the space required for cables such as the interconnection, electrical current cables and the information system connection to the printer must be anticipated. 3. Avoid installing equipment which produces elevated \nmagnetic fi  elds or vibrations like centrifuges, electrical \nmotors, compressors and generators in its vicinity. 4. Avoid locating it directly under the air-conditioning \nsystem (air currents) and sunlight. 5. An electrical outlet which complies with the current \nelectrical standards in the country or the laboratory. It must be in good condition and equipped with a ground pole and switches.Electronic balance operation\nThe operation of a modern electronic balance is clearly detailed in its operat or\u2019s manual from the manufacturer. In \ngeneral, it must conform to the following procedure:1. Allow the balance to equilibrate with the environment \nwhere it is installed. 2. Allow the balance to warm-up before initiating activities. Normally it is suffi   cient to have it connected to the \nelectrical feed system. Some manufacturers suggest at least 20 minutes from the moment it is energized until use. Analytical balances Class 1 require at least 2 hours for warming before initiating use. Verify that the balance is calibrated. Electronic \nbalances generally have a factory-made calibration stored in memory which can be used if it does not have calibration masses. If calibration is required, use calibrated masses as indicated by the manufacturer. The calibrated masses must conform or exceed the ASTM tolerances. For general information, the following table shows the accepted tolerance for the ASTM Class 1\n1 \nmasses. 3.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Diff using tray. Device located at the bottom of the water bath to support the containers located inside the tank. It also allows thermal conve ction currents generated \nin the fl  uid contained in the tank to circulate from top to bottom and back to the top, maintaining the temperature homogeneous  at the level selected by the operator. In general the diff  using tray is made of stainless steel. Electrostatic painting. A painting process that uses the particle-attracting property of electrostatic charges. A potential diff  erence of 80-150kV is applied to a \ngrid of wires through which the paint is sprayed to charge each particle. The metal objects to be sprayed are connected to the opposite terminal of the high-voltage \ncircuit, so that they attract the particles of paint. The piece covered with paint particles is then placed in an electrical ov en to melt the particles, making them adhere \nstrongly to the piece. Fuse. A safety device which protects the electrical circuits from excessive current. Fuses are made of materials whose dimensions an d properties equip them to \nwork well within some predefi  ned conditions. If for some reason the design parameters are exceeded, the material burns out and interrupts the passage of the \nelectrical current. Immersion resistor . An electrical resistor (see defi  nition below) inside of a sealed tube. These are generally used for heating fl  uids as water o r oil. Resistance. Opposition that a material or electrical circuit imposes to the fl  ow of electric current. It is the property of a circuit that  transforms electrical energy \ninto heat as it opposes the fl  ow of current. The resistance [R], of a body of uniform section such as a wire, is directly propo rtional to the length [l] and inversely \nproportional to the sectional area [a]. The resistance is calculated by the following equation:\nR=k\u00d7l\na\nWhere: \nk  = constant that depends on the units employed \nl  = Length of the conductor a  = sectional area of the conductor \nThe ohm (\u03a9) is the common unit of electrical resistance; one ohm is equal to one volt per ampere.MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n35Chapter 6\nBiological Safety Cabinet\nThis equipment is designed for controlling aerosols and \nmicroparticles associated with managing potentially toxic or infectious biological material in laboratories in activities such as agitation, centrifugation, pipetting, and opening of pressurized containers.

The rotors generally made of aluminium [Al] are \ncovered by a fi  lm of anodized aluminium which protects \ntheir metal structure. 9. Use plastic brushes when cleaning the rotor. Metal \nbrushes scratch the protective coating and generate sources for future corrosion. Corrosion is accelerated in operation conditions and shortens the rotor\u2019s operational life. 10. If there are spills of corrosive substances, wash the rotor \nimmediately. 11. Air dry the rotor once cleaned and washed with water.12. Store vertical tube rotors and almost vertical tube rotors \nwith the larger side facing downwards and without their covers. 13. Store rotors in a dry area. Avoid leaving them in the \ncentrifuge. 14. Store swinging buckets rotors without the compartments\u2019 \ncovers. 15. Lubricate spiral and O-rings, according to the \nmanufacturer\u2019s recommendation. 16. Observe re commendations related to guaranteed times \nand operational life of each type of rotor. 17. Av oid using rotors whose operational lives have \nended. 18. Use a shield if working with radioactive material. 19. Load or unload rotors inside a biological safety cabinet \nif working with materials classifi  ed as Biosafety level II \nor higher. 20. Never try to open the cover of a centrifuge while it is \nfunctioning and never try to stop the rotor by hand. Tubes \nTube care includes aspects such as fi  lling of the tubes, adequat e temperature selection, centrifugation speed \nlimitations, washing and sterilization. The principle recommendations are the following:1. Wash tubes, adaptors and other accessories by hand \nusing a 1:10 mild detergent solution in water and a soft textured brush (not metallic). Avoid using automatic dishwashers. 2. Avoid using alcohol and acetone since such liquids aff  ect \nthe structure of the tubes. Manufacturers recommend the solvent to be used with each type of centrifugation tube material. 3. Avoid drying tubes in a drying oven. Dry always with a \nstream of hot air.4. Verify if the tubes are reusable or not. If they are \ndisposable, use them only once. 5. For sterilizing, it is necessary to verify the material from \nwhich the tube is made, as not all can stand sterilization by heat. Glass tubes are normally sterilized with vapour at 121 \u00b0C for 30 minutes. 6. Store tubes and bottles in a dark, fresh, dry place, \nfar from chemical vapours or ultraviolet radiation sources. 7. Verify maximum fi  lling levels and the sealing of thin \nwall tubes in order to avoid collapse inside the rotor by the action of the centrifugal force. Comply with manufacturers recommendations. Preventive maintenance\nWarning:  Nev er carry out a technical intervention in a \ncentrifuge if it has not been previously decontaminated. The most important maintenance routines performed on a \ncentrifuge are the following:Frequency: Monthly1. Verify that the centrifuge external components are free \nof dust and stains. Avoid aff  ecting the rotor with spills. Clean the rotor compartment using a mild detergent. 2. Test that the rotors\u2019 connecting and adjustment \nmechanisms are in good condition. Keep the points lubricated as the manufacturer recommends. 3. Verify the locking \/safety mechanism of the centrifuge\u2019s \ncover. This is fundamental in guaranteeing operators\u2019 safety as this mechanism keeps the cover of the centrifuge closed while the rotor is turning. 4.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Soak the electrode to eliminate the bubbles.

Its purpose is to give a better \nunderstanding of the technical requirements regarding installation, use and maintenance of various types of equipment which play an important role in performing diagnostic testing. The manual also aims to provide support to personnel responsible for technical management, implementation of quality management and maintenance. Due to the diversity of origins, brands and models, this manual off  ers general recommendations. Equipment-specifi  c details \nare explained in depth in the maintenance and installation user manuals from manufacturers. These should be requested and ordered through the procurement processes of the individual agencies and professionals responsible for the acquisition of technology, or directly from the manufacturer. This manual was originally developed by the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) to support improved quality \nprogrammes which PAHO promotes in regional laboratories. The English version was produced by WHO to further expand support for quality programmes in other regions. The revised edition now includes 20 equipment groups selected to cover those most commonly used in low to medium technical complexity laboratories across the world. Given the diff  erences in \ntechnical complexity, brands and existing models, each chapter has been developed with basic equipment in mind, including new technology where relevant. The following information is included in each chapter: \n\u2022\u2022 Groups of equipment, organized by their generic names. Alternative names have also been included. \u2022\u2022 Photographs or diagrams, or a combination of both t o identify the type of equipment under consideration. \u2022\u2022 A brief explanation on the main uses or applications of the equipment in the laboratory. \u2022\u2022 A basic description of the principles by which the equipment operates with explanations of principles or physical and\/or \nchemical la ws which the interested reader can \u2013 or should study in depth. \u2022\u2022 Installation requirements with emphasis on the electrical aspects and the r equirements for safe installation and operation, \nincluding worldwide electrical standards. \u2022\u2022 Basic routine maintenance, classifi  ed according to the required frequency (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually \nor sporadically). The procedures are numbered and presented in the actual sequence in which these should take place (model-specifi  c procedures can be found in the manuals published by the manufacturers). \u2022\u2022 Troubleshooting tables with the most frequent problems aff  ecting the equipment with possible causes and actions that \nmay resolve these problems. \u2022\u2022 A list of basic defi  nitions of some of the specialized terms used.<\/DOCUMENT>\n2.

In the laboratory, the balance is used \nfor weighing as part of quality control activities (on devices like pipettes), in the preparation of mixtures of components in predefined proportions and in the determination of specifi  c densities or weights. OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThere are diff  erences in design, principles and criteria of \nmetrology amongst balances. At present, there are two large groups of balances: mechanical and electronic balances. Mechanical balances \nThe following are some of the more common ones: 1. Spring balance. Its function is based on a mechanical \nproperty of springs as the force exercised on a spring is proportional to the spring\u2019s elasticity constant [k], multiplied by its elongation [x] [F = -kx]. The greater the mass [m] placed on the balance\u2019s plate, the greater the elongation will be, given that the elongation is proportional to the mass and the spring\u2019s constant. The calibration of a spring balance depends on the force of gravity acting on the object weighed. This type of balance is used when great precision is not necessary. 2. Sliding weight balance. This type of balance is \nequipped with two known weights which can be moved on setting scales (one macro, the other micro). Upon placing a substance of unknown mass on the tray, its weight is determined by moving the weight on both setting scales until the equilibrium position is reached. At this point, the weight is obtained by adding both quantities indicated by the sliding masses\u2019 position on the scale. 3. Analytical balance. This balance functions by comparing \nknown weight masses with that of a substance of unknown weight. It is composed of a base on a bar or symmetrical lever, maintained by a blade-like support on a central point called a fulcrum. At its ends, there are stirrups, also supported with blades which allow these to oscillate smoothly. From there, two plates are suspended. Certifi  ed weights are placed on one \nof the plates and unknown weights on the other. The balance has a securing system or lock, which allows the main lever to remain stable when not in use or when it is necessary to modify the counter-weights. The balance is inside an external box which protects it from interferences, such as air currents. Analytical balances can weigh ten thousandths of a gram (0.0001 g) or 100 thousandths of a gram (0.00001 g). This type of balance generally has a capacity of up to 200 grams.

Analytical balance  MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n23It is necessary to have a set of certifi  ed masses. The set is \ngenerally composed of the following pieces:\n4. Upper plate balance (Top loading or parallel guidance \nbalance). This type of balance has a loading plate located \non its upper part, supported by a column maintained in a vertical position by two pairs of guides with fl  exible \nconnections. The eff  ect of the force produced by the \nmass is transmitted from a point on the vertical column directly or by some mechanical means to the loading cell. The requirement with this type of mechanism is that parallel guides must be maintained with exactitude of up to \u00b1 1  \u00b5m. Deviations in parallelism cause an error known \nas lateral load (when the mass being weighed shows diff erences if the reading is taken at the centre of the \nplate or on one of its sides).

The following is a general explanation of the components of a distiller and a description of how these function. 1. Vapour generator. Also known as the boiling tank, \nthis component is the container where the water to be distilled is stored. In general, it has a hydraulic connection which allows the water evaporated and distilled to be replenished. It is generally made of glass in small distillers or of stainless steel with copper, tin or titanium coverings in large capacity machines. It can have level, fl  ow and water quality feed controls, which \nprotect the distiller in case some irregularity in the water supply occurs. As a source of energy, it uses the water vapour coming from a boiler or vapour generator, or the thermal energy from electrical immersion resistors through direct conduction. These cause the water temperature to rise until, in normal conditions (atmospheric pressure equal to an atmosphere and gravity acceleration equal to 9.80665 m\/s\n2) water in the \nliquid phase is transformed into vapour at 100 \u00b0C. 2.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>The responsibility for the interpretation and use of the  material lies with the reader.

The rotors generally made of aluminium [Al] are \ncovered by a fi  lm of anodized aluminium which protects \ntheir metal structure. 9. Use plastic brushes when cleaning the rotor. Metal \nbrushes scratch the protective coating and generate sources for future corrosion. Corrosion is accelerated in operation conditions and shortens the rotor\u2019s operational life. 10. If there are spills of corrosive substances, wash the rotor \nimmediately. 11. Air dry the rotor once cleaned and washed with water.12. Store vertical tube rotors and almost vertical tube rotors \nwith the larger side facing downwards and without their covers. 13. Store rotors in a dry area. Avoid leaving them in the \ncentrifuge. 14. Store swinging buckets rotors without the compartments\u2019 \ncovers. 15.

Never try to open the cover of a centrifuge while it is \nfunctioning and never try to stop the rotor by hand. Tubes \nTube care includes aspects such as fi  lling of the tubes, adequat e temperature selection, centrifugation speed \nlimitations, washing and sterilization. The principle recommendations are the following:1. Wash tubes, adaptors and other accessories by hand \nusing a 1:10 mild detergent solution in water and a soft textured brush (not metallic). Avoid using automatic dishwashers. 2. Avoid using alcohol and acetone since such liquids aff  ect \nthe structure of the tubes. Manufacturers recommend the solvent to be used with each type of centrifugation tube material. 3. Avoid drying tubes in a drying oven. Dry always with a \nstream of hot air.4. Verify if the tubes are reusable or not. If they are \ndisposable, use them only once. 5. For sterilizing, it is necessary to verify the material from \nwhich the tube is made, as not all can stand sterilization by heat. Glass tubes are normally sterilized with vapour at 121 \u00b0C for 30 minutes. 6. Store tubes and bottles in a dark, fresh, dry place, \nfar from chemical vapours or ultraviolet radiation sources. 7.

These syringes are selected and installed in the dilutor depending on the densities, viscosities, and volumes of fluids to be manipulated. The fluids are transported through flexible tubes, whose diameters, lengths and chemical compatibility are taken into account in the design and manufacturing process for suitability with the selected activity. These tubes are linked using connections manually adjustable. Normally, the syringes are classifi  ed according to \ntheir use (e.g. syringes for reagents, diluents, samples), and the volume these manipulate. The following table shows an example of how they are classifi  ed according to their size \nand managed volumes. Opposite, the components of the dispensing system (syringe \nand dispenser) are shown. INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS\nThe dilutor must be installed on a clean, dry and extremely levelled counter or work surface, far from areas where there \nmay be vapours which can aff  ect its functioning. There must be free space around the equipment for \nfacilitating ventilation and the passage of cables and interconnection lines and cables with the solvent containers, computers or supply systems. The space around the dilutor should be approximately 10 cm. There must be a 115 V, 60 Hz electrical outlet in good \ncondition with a ground pole or alternatively one of 220\u2013240 V, 50\/60 Hz, depending on the manufacturer\u2019s specifi  cations \nand\/or the electrical norms in the country of use.ROUTINE MAINTENANCE \nThe routine maintenance focuses mainly on eliminating contaminants which may accumulate inside the fluid \nmechanisms and\/or lines.

Substitution Balance (Unequal-lever arm or two-\nknife balance). This is a balance with a single plate. An unknown mass is placed on the weighing plate. It is weighed by removing known masses from the counterweight side until it reaches a balanced position, using a mechanical system of cams. The fulcrum is generally off  -centre in relation to the length of the load \nbeam and located near the front of the balance. When a mass is placed on the weight plate and the balance\u2019s locking mechanism is released, the movement of the load beam is projected through an optical system to a screen located on the front part of the instrument. Operation veri\ufb01  cation\nThe procedure used for verifying the functioning of a typical \nmechanical balanc e is described below. The described \nprocess is based on the substitution balance.1. Verify that the balance is levelled. The levelling is \nachieved using a ring-shaped adjustment mechanism located on the base of the balance or by adjusting a bubble or knob on a scale located on the front of the balance\u2019s base. 2. Test the  zero mechanism. Place the controls on zero \nand free the balance. If the reading does not stay at zero, adjust the zero mechanism (a grooved screw located in a horizontal position near the fulcrum). To do this, it is necessary to block the balance and slightly adjust the mechanism. The process is to be continued until the zero adjusts correctly on the reading scale.3. Verify and adjust the sensitivity. This is always readjusted \nwhenever some internal adjustment is done. It is performed with a known standard according to the following steps:\na) Lock the balance.b) Place a standard weight (equivalent to the optical \nscale range) on the plate. c) Position the micro setting to one (1). d) Release the balance. e) Adjust to the zero position.f) Position the micro setting to zero (0). The balance \nshould indicate 100. If the scale displays less or more than 100, the sensitivity control must be adjusted. This requires locking the balance, opening the upper cover and turning the sensitivity screw: If the scale registers more than 100; turn the screw in a clockwise position. If the scale registers less than 100, it is necessary to unwind the screw anticlockwise. Repeat the process until the balance is adjusted (adjusting the zero and the sensitivity).Type of mass Capacity\nSimple pieces \n 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 g \n100, 200 and 500 g \nFractional pieces \n 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 mg \n100, 200 and 500 mg \nMass\nPlate\nFlexible\nConnections\nSupport ColumnFGFigure 10.

OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThere are diff  erences in design, principles and criteria of \nmetrology amongst balances. At present, there are two large groups of balances: mechanical and electronic balances. Mechanical balances \nThe following are some of the more common ones: 1. Spring balance. Its function is based on a mechanical \nproperty of springs as the force exercised on a spring is proportional to the spring\u2019s elasticity constant [k], multiplied by its elongation [x] [F = -kx]. The greater the mass [m] placed on the balance\u2019s plate, the greater the elongation will be, given that the elongation is proportional to the mass and the spring\u2019s constant. The calibration of a spring balance depends on the force of gravity acting on the object weighed. This type of balance is used when great precision is not necessary. 2. Sliding weight balance. This type of balance is \nequipped with two known weights which can be moved on setting scales (one macro, the other micro). Upon placing a substance of unknown mass on the tray, its weight is determined by moving the weight on both setting scales until the equilibrium position is reached. At this point, the weight is obtained by adding both quantities indicated by the sliding masses\u2019 position on the scale. 3. Analytical balance. This balance functions by comparing \nknown weight masses with that of a substance of unknown weight. It is composed of a base on a bar or symmetrical lever, maintained by a blade-like support on a central point called a fulcrum. At its ends, there are stirrups, also supported with blades which allow these to oscillate smoothly. From there, two plates are suspended. Certifi  ed weights are placed on one \nof the plates and unknown weights on the other. The balance has a securing system or lock, which allows the main lever to remain stable when not in use or when it is necessary to modify the counter-weights. The balance is inside an external box which protects it from interferences, such as air currents. Analytical balances can weigh ten thousandths of a gram (0.0001 g) or 100 thousandths of a gram (0.00001 g). This type of balance generally has a capacity of up to 200 grams.

Analytical balance  MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n23It is necessary to have a set of certifi  ed masses. The set is \ngenerally composed of the following pieces:\n4. Upper plate balance (Top loading or parallel guidance \nbalance). This type of balance has a loading plate located \non its upper part, supported by a column maintained in a vertical position by two pairs of guides with fl  exible \nconnections. The eff  ect of the force produced by the \nmass is transmitted from a point on the vertical column directly or by some mechanical means to the loading cell. The requirement with this type of mechanism is that parallel guides must be maintained with exactitude of up to \u00b1 1  \u00b5m. Deviations in parallelism cause an error known \nas lateral load (when the mass being weighed shows diff erences if the reading is taken at the centre of the \nplate or on one of its sides). The diagram shown below explains the operation principle some manufacturers have introduced in electronic balances.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Cleaning oil and grease.

This is a balance with a single plate. An unknown mass is placed on the weighing plate. It is weighed by removing known masses from the counterweight side until it reaches a balanced position, using a mechanical system of cams. The fulcrum is generally off  -centre in relation to the length of the load \nbeam and located near the front of the balance. When a mass is placed on the weight plate and the balance\u2019s locking mechanism is released, the movement of the load beam is projected through an optical system to a screen located on the front part of the instrument. Operation veri\ufb01  cation\nThe procedure used for verifying the functioning of a typical \nmechanical balanc e is described below. The described \nprocess is based on the substitution balance.1. Verify that the balance is levelled. The levelling is \nachieved using a ring-shaped adjustment mechanism located on the base of the balance or by adjusting a bubble or knob on a scale located on the front of the balance\u2019s base. 2. Test the  zero mechanism. Place the controls on zero \nand free the balance. If the reading does not stay at zero, adjust the zero mechanism (a grooved screw located in a horizontal position near the fulcrum). To do this, it is necessary to block the balance and slightly adjust the mechanism. The process is to be continued until the zero adjusts correctly on the reading scale.3. Verify and adjust the sensitivity. This is always readjusted \nwhenever some internal adjustment is done. It is performed with a known standard according to the following steps:\na) Lock the balance.b) Place a standard weight (equivalent to the optical \nscale range) on the plate. c) Position the micro setting to one (1). d) Release the balance. e) Adjust to the zero position.f) Position the micro setting to zero (0). The balance \nshould indicate 100. If the scale displays less or more than 100, the sensitivity control must be adjusted. This requires locking the balance, opening the upper cover and turning the sensitivity screw: If the scale registers more than 100; turn the screw in a clockwise position. If the scale registers less than 100, it is necessary to unwind the screw anticlockwise. Repeat the process until the balance is adjusted (adjusting the zero and the sensitivity).Type of mass Capacity\nSimple pieces \n 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 g \n100, 200 and 500 g \nFractional pieces \n 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 mg \n100, 200 and 500 mg \nMass\nPlate\nFlexible\nConnections\nSupport ColumnFGFigure 10.

The \ncentrifuge is designed to use the centrifugal force generated in rotational movements to separate the constitutive elements of a mixture. There is a wide range of centrifuges capable of serving specifi  c industry and research needs. This \nchapter focuses on standing centrifuges normally used in public health and clinical laboratories. PHOTOGRAPH OF CENTRIFUGEPURPOSE OF THE CENTRIFUGE\nThe centrifuge uses centrifugal force (the force generated \nwhen an objec t rotates around a single point), for separating \nsolids suspended in a liquid by sedimentation, or liquids of diverse density. The rotational movements allow forces much greater than gravity to be generated in controlled periods of time. In the laboratory, centrifuges are generally used in processes such as the separation of solid components from biological liquids through sedimentation and in particular of blood components: red cells, white cells, platelets among others and for conducting multiple tests and treatments.There are several kinds of centrifuges. The most widely used in public health, surveillance and clinical laboratories are the table-top centrifuge, the ultracentrifuge, the haeamatocrit centrifuge and the standing centrifuge. OPERATION PRINCIPLES \nCentrifuges represent a practical application of Newton\u2019s law of motion. When a body of mass [m] turns around \na central point [O], it is subjected to a centripetal  force \n[N] directed towards the rotation axis with a magnitude N = m\u03c9\n2R, where [m] is the mass of the body, [R] is the radius \nand \u03c9 is the angular speed. Centrifuges possess a rotating axis on which is mounted a rotor with sample receiving compartments. Tangential speed is defi  ned by the following \nequation: VT=\u03c9R. Photo courtesy of Beckman CoulterCHAPTER 7  CENTRIFUGE\n46When the system spins at a speed of \u03c9 radians per second, \nthe samples are subjected to the centrifugal force Fp of the \nsame magnitude as N, but in an opposite direction. The \nfi gure shown below1 features a diagram of the concept, \nof its actual application and of the obtained result. This Fp force acts on particles in the substance centrifuged, \ncausing them to separate as a result of diff  erences in density. Denser particles will settle at the bottom of the tube in shorter periods of time, while lighter ones require longer periods of time, settling onto those of greater density. The relationship between the centrifugal acceleration [\u03c9\n2r ] to a \ngiven radius [r] and the force of gravity [g] is known as the relative centrifugal fi  eld or [RCF]\n2. RCF =r\u03c92\ng\nThe RCF is the tool which allows rotors of different \nspecifi  cations to be compared when equivalent centrifugal \neff ects are required. COMPONENTS OF THE CENTRIFUGE \nThe most important components of a centrifuge are the \nfollowing3:\nThe electric\/electronic control which generally has the following elements:1. On and off control, operation time control (timer), \nrotation speed control (in some centrifuges), temperature control (in refrigerated centrifuges), vibration control (safety mechanism) and brake system.2. Refrigeration system (in refrigerated centrifuges). 3. Vacuum system (in ultracentrifuges, not shown in the \nfi gure). 4.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>The following process is generally done:1. Unscrew the top of the fi  lter. 2. Remove the used fi  ltering element. 3. Install a new element with the same characteristics as \nthe original. 4. Reinstall the top of the fi  lter. Warning:  The fi  lter is adjusted inside its casing by means \nof O-rings or gaskets that must be installed carefully within their grooves in order to avoid leaks of distilled water. Cleaning of the condenser\nFrequency: Annually 1. In order to clean the condenser, it is necessary to remove \nthe protective panels or open the door, giving access to the condenser. 2. Verify that the distiller is disconnected from the electrical \noutlet. 3. Remove the condenser. Disconnect the linkage system \nfor the entry of vapour and the connection which links the condenser to the distilled product storage tank. 4. Remove screws joining the ventilator with the condenser. Disconnect the ventilator terminals from its connection points. 5. Remove the ventilator and clean the dirt accumulated \non the blades. Lubricate the rotation axis with mineral oil (two drops). 6.

Only professionals who have received the relevant training must conduct such procedures.ROUTINE MAINTENANCE\nWarning:  The maintenance of internal components must \nonly be done by trained and qualifi  ed personnel. In order \nto carry out maintenance on the internal components, decontamination must be done previously. Personal protection must be worn to perform the routines.

This enables the meter to read the pH of the calibration solution. For example: For a solution at pH = 7, the needle can oscillate slightly in units of 0.1 pH; on average, the reading should be 7. The reading of the meter (reading scale) should be done perpendicularly, to avoid or eliminate parallel-type errors (reading errors produced by the shadow of the meter\u2019s needle, visible on the mirror of the reading scale). The pH meter is then ready (calibrated), to carry out the correct pH readings.<\/DOCUMENT>\n5.

Recently manufactured centrifuges have incorporated \nnumerous improvements into their design to provide greater safety and longer operational life. Among advances mentioned are controls based on microprocessors. By means of software  controlled by a keyboard, these have several \ndiff erent operational programs in memory. According to the \ntype of rotor being used and procedure conducted, these programs control the centrifugation time, the required temperature, the rotor\u2019s revolutions, the acceleration and deceleration, alarms warning the operator about any anomaly during operation. Manufacturers have also incorporated induction motors \n(without brushes) in centrifuges. These have the advantage of electronically controlling currents and magnetic fields regulating the rotor\u2019s speed which reduces the frequency of maintenance. Operation and maintenance of such equipment must be carried out according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS\nCentrifuges require the following for normal operation:1. An electrical connection with a capacity suitable for the \nequipment providing stable single phase or triphase type voltage (depending on the model and specifi  cation \ngiven by the manufacturer).

The reference electrode is usually made of the same type of material as the internal electrode. Both tubes, interior and exterior, contain a reference solution. Only the outer tube has contact with the measured solution through a porous cap which acts as a saline bridge. This device acts like a galvanized cell. The reference electrode \nis the internal tube of the pH meter probe, which cannot lose ions through interactions with the surrounding environment. Therefore as a reference, it remains static (unchangeable) during the measuring process. The external tube of the probe contains the medium which is allowed  to mix with the external environment. As a result, this tube must be fi lled periodically with a potassium chloride solution (KCI) \nfor restoring the capacity of the electrode which would otherwise be inhibited by a loss of ions and evaporation. The glass bulb on the lower part of the pH electrode acts \nas a measuring element and is covered with a layer of hydrated gel on its exterior and interior. Metallic sodium cations [Na\n+] are diff  used in the hydrated gel outside of \nthe glass and in the solution, while the hydrogen ions [H+] \nare diff  used in the gel. This gel makes the pH electrode \nion-selective:  Hydrogen ions [H+] cannot pass through the \nglass membrane of the pH electrode. Sodium ions [Na+] pass \nthrough and cause a change in free energy, which the pH meter measures. A brief explanation of the theory on how electrodes function is included in the appendix at the end of the chapter.pH METER COMPONENTS \nA pH meter generally has the following components: 1. The body of the instrument containing the circuits, \ncontrols, connectors, display screens and measuring scales. The following are among some of its most \nimportant components:\na) An ON and OFF switch. Not all pH meters have an \non and off   switch. Some simply have a cord with a \nplug which allows it to be connected to a suitable electrical outlet. b) Temperature control. This control allows \nadjustments according to the temperature of the solution measured. c) Calibration controls. Depending on the design, \npH meters possess one or two calibration buttons or dials. Normally these are identifi  ed by Cal 1  and \nCal 2 . If the pH meter is calibrated using only one \nsolution, the Cal 1 button is used; making sure that Cal 2 is set at a 100%. If the pH meter allows  two point calibrations, two known pH solutions covering the range of pH to be measured are used. In this case, the two controls are used (Cal 1 and Cal 2). In special cases, a three-point calibration must be done (using three known pH solutions). d) Mode selector.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>5.

Likewise, the space required for cables such as the interconnection, electrical current cables and the information system connection to the printer must be anticipated. 3. Avoid installing equipment which produces elevated \nmagnetic fi  elds or vibrations like centrifuges, electrical \nmotors, compressors and generators in its vicinity. 4.

In \ngeneral, it must conform to the following procedure:1. Allow the balance to equilibrate with the environment \nwhere it is installed. 2. Allow the balance to warm-up before initiating activities. Normally it is suffi   cient to have it connected to the \nelectrical feed system. Some manufacturers suggest at least 20 minutes from the moment it is energized until use. Analytical balances Class 1 require at least 2 hours for warming before initiating use. Verify that the balance is calibrated. Electronic \nbalances generally have a factory-made calibration stored in memory which can be used if it does not have calibration masses. If calibration is required, use calibrated masses as indicated by the manufacturer. The calibrated masses must conform or exceed the ASTM tolerances.

Never try to open the cover of a centrifuge while it is \nfunctioning and never try to stop the rotor by hand. Tubes \nTube care includes aspects such as fi  lling of the tubes, adequat e temperature selection, centrifugation speed \nlimitations, washing and sterilization. The principle recommendations are the following:1. Wash tubes, adaptors and other accessories by hand \nusing a 1:10 mild detergent solution in water and a soft textured brush (not metallic). Avoid using automatic dishwashers. 2. Avoid using alcohol and acetone since such liquids aff  ect \nthe structure of the tubes. Manufacturers recommend the solvent to be used with each type of centrifugation tube material. 3. Avoid drying tubes in a drying oven. Dry always with a \nstream of hot air.4. Verify if the tubes are reusable or not. If they are \ndisposable, use them only once. 5. For sterilizing, it is necessary to verify the material from \nwhich the tube is made, as not all can stand sterilization by heat. Glass tubes are normally sterilized with vapour at 121 \u00b0C for 30 minutes. 6. Store tubes and bottles in a dark, fresh, dry place, \nfar from chemical vapours or ultraviolet radiation sources. 7. Verify maximum fi  lling levels and the sealing of thin \nwall tubes in order to avoid collapse inside the rotor by the action of the centrifugal force. Comply with manufacturers recommendations. Preventive maintenance\nWarning:  Nev er carry out a technical intervention in a \ncentrifuge if it has not been previously decontaminated. The most important maintenance routines performed on a \ncentrifuge are the following:Frequency: Monthly1. Verify that the centrifuge external components are free \nof dust and stains.

The mass in grams of this amount of a substance, numerically equal to the molecular weight of the substance, also called gram-molecular weight. pH. Measurement of the concentration of the hydrogen ion (H+) given in moles per litre (M) in a solution. The pH concept was proposed by S\u00f8rensen and Lindstr\u00f8m-\nLang in 1909 to facilitate expressing very low ion concentrations. It is defi  ned by the following equation:pH = \u2013log [H\n+]      or      [H+] = 10-pH \nIt measures the acidity of a solution. Example, in water the concentration of [H+] is 1.0 x 10-7 M resulting in pH = 7. This allows the range of concentrations from \n1 to 10-14 M, to be expressed from zero (0) to 14. There are diverse systems for measuring the acidity of a solution. An acidic substance  dissolved in water is capable \nof producing H+ ions. A basic substance dissolved in water is capable of producing [OH\u2013] (hydroxides) ions. An acid substance has a greater quantity of ions [H+] than pure water; a basic substance shows greater quantities of ions [OH\u2013] than pure water. The concentrations \nof substances are expressed in moles per litre. In pure water, the ion concentration [H+] and [OH\u2013] is 1.0 x 10\u20137 M, it is thus considered a neutral substance. In reality, it is a weak electrolyte that is dissociated \nfollowing the following equation:H\n2O  '  [H+][OH\u2013] \nIn all aqueous solutions there is a balance expressed as:   \n[H+][OH\u2013] = K \n     H2O\nIf the solution is diluted, the concentration of the non-dissociated water can be considered constant:\n[H+][OH\u2013] = [H2O]K = Ka\nThe new constant Ka is called a constant of dissociation or ionic product of water and its value is 1.0x10\u201314 at 25 \u00b0C. [H+][OH\u2013] = 1.0 x 10-14\nX x X = 1.0 x 10-14\nX2 = 1.0 x 10-14\nX = 1.0 x 10-7\nIn pure water the concentrations of H+ and OH\u2013 are 1.0 x 10\u20137 M, a very low concentration, given that the molar concentration of water is 55.4 mol\/litre.

If for some \nreason, the electrode becomes dry, it is necessary to soak it for at least 24 hours before use. 1.5 R inse the electrode with distilled water in an empty \nbeaker. 1.6 Dry the electrode with material able to absorb \nresidual liquid on its surface, without impregnating the electrode. To avoid possible contamination, the electrodes must be rinsed between diff  erent \nsolutions. 1 Verify the type of buff  er solution recommended by the electrode \nmanufacturer.MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n172. Place electrodes in the calibration solution. 2.1 Submerge the electrode in the standardization \nsolution in such a manner that its lower extremity does not touch the bottom of the beaker. This decreases the risk of breaking the electrode. If the test requires that the solution be kept in motion using the magnetic agitator, special care must be taken so that the agitation rod does not hit the electrode as this could break it. Buff  er solution \nis used as a calibration solution, because its pH is known and therefore will still be maintained even if a little contamination occurs.

A set of reagents used for verifying the quality of washing done on the wells used i n the ELISA technique.MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n13Chapter 3\npH Meter\nThe pH meter is used for determining the concentration of \nhydrogen ions [H+] in a solution. This equipment, provided \nit is carefully used and calibrated, measures the acidity of an aqueous solution. pH meters are sometimes called pH analysers, pH monitors or potentiometers. PURPOSE OF THE EQUIPMENT\nThe pH meter is commonly used in any fi  eld of science \nrelated to aqueous solutions. It is used in areas such as agriculture, water treatment and purifi  cation, in industrial \nprocesses such as petrochemicals, paper manufacture, foods, pharmaceuticals, research and development, metal mechanics, etc. In the health laboratory, its applications are related to the control of culture mediums and to the measurement of the alkalinity or acidity of broths and buff ers. In specialized laboratories, diagnostic equipment \nmicroelectrodes are used to measure the pH of liquid blood components. The plasma pH allows the patient\u2019s health to be evaluated. It normally measures between 7.35 and 7.45. This value relates to the patient\u2019s metabolism in which a multitude of reactions occurs where acids and bases are normally kept in balance. Acids constantly liberate hydrogen ions [H\n+] and the organism neutralizes or balances \nacidity by liberating bicarbonate ions [HCO3\u2013]. The acid-base \nratio in the organism is maintained by the kidneys, (organs in which any excesses present are eliminated). The plasma pH is one of the characteristics that vary with factors such as age or state of health of the patient. Table 1 shows typical pH values of some bodily fl  uids.PHOTOGRAPH AND COMPONENTS OF THE \npH METER\nOPERA TION PRINCIPLES\nThe pH meter measures the concentration of hydrogen ions \n[H+] using an ion-sensitive electrode.

Avoid using automatic dishwashers. 2. Avoid using alcohol and acetone since such liquids aff  ect \nthe structure of the tubes. Manufacturers recommend the solvent to be used with each type of centrifugation tube material. 3. Avoid drying tubes in a drying oven. Dry always with a \nstream of hot air.4. Verify if the tubes are reusable or not. If they are \ndisposable, use them only once. 5. For sterilizing, it is necessary to verify the material from \nwhich the tube is made, as not all can stand sterilization by heat. Glass tubes are normally sterilized with vapour at 121 \u00b0C for 30 minutes. 6. Store tubes and bottles in a dark, fresh, dry place, \nfar from chemical vapours or ultraviolet radiation sources. 7.

A measuring device known as \u201cload cell\u201d produces an \nexit signal corresponding to the load\u2019s force in the form of changes in the voltage or frequency. 3. A digital analogous electronic circuit shows the fi  nal \nresult of the weight digitally. Laboratory balances operate according to the principle \nof compensation of the electromagnetic force applicable to displacements or torques. The combination of their mechanical components and automatic reading systems provides weight measurements at defi  ned levels of accuracy \ndepending on the model. Principle. The mobile parts (weighing plate, support \ncolumn [a], bobbin, position and load indicator [G] -the object in the process of being weighed-) are maintained in equilibrium by a compensation force [F] equal to the weight. The compensation force is generated by an electrical current through a bobbin in the air gap of a cylindrical electromagnet. The force F is calculated with the equation [F = I x L x B] where: I = electrical intensity, L = total length of the wire of the coil and B = magnetic fl  ow intensity in the \nelectromagnet\u2019s air gap.With any change in the load (weight\/mass), the mobile \nmechanical system responds by moving vertically a fraction of distance. Detected by a photosensor [e], an electrical signal is sent to the servo-amplifi  er [f]. This changes the \nfl ow of electrical current passing through the bobbin of the \nmagnet [c] in such a manner that the mobile system returns to the balanced position upon adjusting of the magnetic fl ow in the electromagnet. Consequently, the weight of \nthe mass [G] can be measured indirectly at the start of the electrical current fl  ow, which passes through the circuit \nmeasuring the voltage [V] by means of a precision resistor [R], [V = I x R]. To date, many systems developed use the electronic system for carrying out very exact measurements of mass and weight. The following diagram explains how electronic balances function.

The signal process comprises the following functions:1. Tare setting. This setting is used to adjust the reading \nvalue at zero with any load within the balance\u2019s capacity range. It is controlled by a button generally located on the front part of the balance. It is commonly used for taring the weighing container. 2. Repeatability setting control. During a reading, weighed \nvalues are averaged within a predefi  ned period of time. This function is very useful when weighing operations need to be carried out in unstable conditions, e.g. in the presence of air currents or vibrations. This control defi nes the time period allowed for a result to lie within \npreset limits for it to be considered stable. In addition, it can be adjusted to suit a particular application.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Removal or destruction of infectious agents; removal or neutralization of toxic agents. HEPA fi  lter.

Allow the balance to warm-up before initiating activities. Normally it is suffi   cient to have it connected to the \nelectrical feed system. Some manufacturers suggest at least 20 minutes from the moment it is energized until use. Analytical balances Class 1 require at least 2 hours for warming before initiating use. Verify that the balance is calibrated. Electronic \nbalances generally have a factory-made calibration stored in memory which can be used if it does not have calibration masses.

The technique \nis based on the detection of an antigen or antibodies captured on a solid surface using direct or secondary, labelled antibodies, producing a reaction whose product can be read by the spectrophotometer. The word ELISA is the acronym for \u201cEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay\u201d . This chapter covers the use of microplate readers for ELISA testing. For additional information on the instrument principles of operation and maintenance, consult Chapter 11 discussing the spectrophotometer. PHOTOGRAPH OF MICROPLATE READER\nPURPOSE OF THE MICROPLATE READER\nThe microplate reader is used for reading the results of ELISA \ntests. This technique has a direct application in immunology and serology. Among other applications it confi  rms the \npresence of antibodies or antigens of an infectious agent in an organism, antibodies from a vaccine or auto-antibodies, for example in rheumatoid arthritis.OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThe microplate reader is a specialized spectrophotometer. Unlike the c onventional spectrophotometer which facilitates \nreadings on a wide range of wavelengths, the microplate reader has filters or diffraction gratings that limit the wavelength range to that used in ELISA, generally between 400 to 750 nm (nanometres). Some readers operate in the ultraviolet range and carry out analyses between 340 to 700 nm. The optical system exploited by many manufacturers uses optic fi  bres to supply light to the microplate wells \ncontaining the samples. The light beam, passing through the sample has a diameter ranging between 1 to 3 mm. A detection system detects the light coming from the sample, amplifi  es the signal and determines the sample\u2019s \nabsorbance. A reading system converts it into data allowing the test result interpretation. Some microplate readers use double beam light systems. Test samples are located in specially designed plates with \na specifi  c number of wells where the procedure or test is \ncarried out. Plates of 8 columns by 12 rows with a total of 96 wells are common. There are also plates with a greater number of wells. For specialized applications, the current trend is to increase the number of wells (384-well plates) to reduce the amount of reagents and samples used and a greater throughput. The location of the optical sensors of the microplate reader varies depending on the manufacturers: these can be located above the sample plate, or directly underneath the plate\u2019s wells. Nowadays microplate readers have controls regulated by \nmicroprocessors; connection interfaces to information systems; quality and process control programs, which by means of a computer, allow complete test automation.Chapter 1\nMicroplate Reader\nGMDN Code 37036\nECRI Code 16-979\nDenomination Photometric micro-plate reader\nPhoto courtesy of BioRad Laboratories CHAPTER 1  MICROPLATE READER\n2Equipment required for ELISA testing\nIn order to perform the ELISA technique, the following \nequipment is r equired:  \n1.

Place electrodes in the calibration solution. 2.1 Submerge the electrode in the standardization \nsolution in such a manner that its lower extremity does not touch the bottom of the beaker. This decreases the risk of breaking the electrode. If the test requires that the solution be kept in motion using the magnetic agitator, special care must be taken so that the agitation rod does not hit the electrode as this could break it. Buff  er solution \nis used as a calibration solution, because its pH is known and therefore will still be maintained even if a little contamination occurs.

The word comes from the Latin terms bis which means two and lanx , plate.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>The balance has other names \nsuch as scale and weight. It must be taken into account that the weight is the force which the gravitational fi  eld exercises on a body\u2019s mass, this force being the product of the mass \nby the local acceleration of gravity [F = m x g]. The term local is used to emphasize that this acceleration depends on factors such as the geographical latitude, altitude and the Earth\u2019s density where the measurement is taken. This force is measured in Newtons.

In the laboratory, the balance is used \nfor weighing as part of quality control activities (on devices like pipettes), in the preparation of mixtures of components in predefined proportions and in the determination of specifi  c densities or weights. OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThere are diff  erences in design, principles and criteria of \nmetrology amongst balances. At present, there are two large groups of balances: mechanical and electronic balances. Mechanical balances \nThe following are some of the more common ones: 1. Spring balance. Its function is based on a mechanical \nproperty of springs as the force exercised on a spring is proportional to the spring\u2019s elasticity constant [k], multiplied by its elongation [x] [F = -kx]. The greater the mass [m] placed on the balance\u2019s plate, the greater the elongation will be, given that the elongation is proportional to the mass and the spring\u2019s constant. The calibration of a spring balance depends on the force of gravity acting on the object weighed. This type of balance is used when great precision is not necessary. 2. Sliding weight balance. This type of balance is \nequipped with two known weights which can be moved on setting scales (one macro, the other micro). Upon placing a substance of unknown mass on the tray, its weight is determined by moving the weight on both setting scales until the equilibrium position is reached. At this point, the weight is obtained by adding both quantities indicated by the sliding masses\u2019 position on the scale. 3. Analytical balance. This balance functions by comparing \nknown weight masses with that of a substance of unknown weight. It is composed of a base on a bar or symmetrical lever, maintained by a blade-like support on a central point called a fulcrum. At its ends, there are stirrups, also supported with blades which allow these to oscillate smoothly. From there, two plates are suspended. Certifi  ed weights are placed on one \nof the plates and unknown weights on the other. The balance has a securing system or lock, which allows the main lever to remain stable when not in use or when it is necessary to modify the counter-weights. The balance is inside an external box which protects it from interferences, such as air currents. Analytical balances can weigh ten thousandths of a gram (0.0001 g) or 100 thousandths of a gram (0.00001 g). This type of balance generally has a capacity of up to 200 grams.

Analytical balance  MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n23It is necessary to have a set of certifi  ed masses. The set is \ngenerally composed of the following pieces:\n4. Upper plate balance (Top loading or parallel guidance \nbalance). This type of balance has a loading plate located \non its upper part, supported by a column maintained in a vertical position by two pairs of guides with fl  exible \nconnections. The eff  ect of the force produced by the \nmass is transmitted from a point on the vertical column directly or by some mechanical means to the loading cell. The requirement with this type of mechanism is that parallel guides must be maintained with exactitude of up to \u00b1 1  \u00b5m. Deviations in parallelism cause an error known \nas lateral load (when the mass being weighed shows diff erences if the reading is taken at the centre of the \nplate or on one of its sides). The diagram shown below explains the operation principle some manufacturers have introduced in electronic balances.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>5.6 Clean the work area.

Its purpose is to give a better \nunderstanding of the technical requirements regarding installation, use and maintenance of various types of equipment which play an important role in performing diagnostic testing. The manual also aims to provide support to personnel responsible for technical management, implementation of quality management and maintenance. Due to the diversity of origins, brands and models, this manual off  ers general recommendations. Equipment-specifi  c details \nare explained in depth in the maintenance and installation user manuals from manufacturers. These should be requested and ordered through the procurement processes of the individual agencies and professionals responsible for the acquisition of technology, or directly from the manufacturer. This manual was originally developed by the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) to support improved quality \nprogrammes which PAHO promotes in regional laboratories. The English version was produced by WHO to further expand support for quality programmes in other regions. The revised edition now includes 20 equipment groups selected to cover those most commonly used in low to medium technical complexity laboratories across the world. Given the diff  erences in \ntechnical complexity, brands and existing models, each chapter has been developed with basic equipment in mind, including new technology where relevant. The following information is included in each chapter: \n\u2022\u2022 Groups of equipment, organized by their generic names. Alternative names have also been included. \u2022\u2022 Photographs or diagrams, or a combination of both t o identify the type of equipment under consideration. \u2022\u2022 A brief explanation on the main uses or applications of the equipment in the laboratory. \u2022\u2022 A basic description of the principles by which the equipment operates with explanations of principles or physical and\/or \nchemical la ws which the interested reader can \u2013 or should study in depth. \u2022\u2022 Installation requirements with emphasis on the electrical aspects and the r equirements for safe installation and operation, \nincluding worldwide electrical standards. \u2022\u2022 Basic routine maintenance, classifi  ed according to the required frequency (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually \nor sporadically). The procedures are numbered and presented in the actual sequence in which these should take place (model-specifi  c procedures can be found in the manuals published by the manufacturers). \u2022\u2022 Troubleshooting tables with the most frequent problems aff  ecting the equipment with possible causes and actions that \nmay resolve these problems. \u2022\u2022 A list of basic defi  nitions of some of the specialized terms used.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Removal or destruction of infectious agents; removal or neutralization of toxic agents.

This information, along with good use and care, helps to maintain laboratory equipment in optimal condition.MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n1The microplate reader also known as \u201cPhotometric \nmicro-plate reader or ELISA reader\u201d is a specialized spectrophotometer designed to read results of the ELISA test, a technique used to determine the presence of antibodies or specifi  c antigens in samples. The technique \nis based on the detection of an antigen or antibodies captured on a solid surface using direct or secondary, labelled antibodies, producing a reaction whose product can be read by the spectrophotometer. The word ELISA is the acronym for \u201cEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay\u201d . This chapter covers the use of microplate readers for ELISA testing. For additional information on the instrument principles of operation and maintenance, consult Chapter 11 discussing the spectrophotometer. PHOTOGRAPH OF MICROPLATE READER\nPURPOSE OF THE MICROPLATE READER\nThe microplate reader is used for reading the results of ELISA \ntests. This technique has a direct application in immunology and serology. Among other applications it confi  rms the \npresence of antibodies or antigens of an infectious agent in an organism, antibodies from a vaccine or auto-antibodies, for example in rheumatoid arthritis.OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThe microplate reader is a specialized spectrophotometer. Unlike the c onventional spectrophotometer which facilitates \nreadings on a wide range of wavelengths, the microplate reader has filters or diffraction gratings that limit the wavelength range to that used in ELISA, generally between 400 to 750 nm (nanometres). Some readers operate in the ultraviolet range and carry out analyses between 340 to 700 nm. The optical system exploited by many manufacturers uses optic fi  bres to supply light to the microplate wells \ncontaining the samples. The light beam, passing through the sample has a diameter ranging between 1 to 3 mm. A detection system detects the light coming from the sample, amplifi  es the signal and determines the sample\u2019s \nabsorbance. A reading system converts it into data allowing the test result interpretation. Some microplate readers use double beam light systems. Test samples are located in specially designed plates with \na specifi  c number of wells where the procedure or test is \ncarried out. Plates of 8 columns by 12 rows with a total of 96 wells are common. There are also plates with a greater number of wells. For specialized applications, the current trend is to increase the number of wells (384-well plates) to reduce the amount of reagents and samples used and a greater throughput. The location of the optical sensors of the microplate reader varies depending on the manufacturers: these can be located above the sample plate, or directly underneath the plate\u2019s wells. Nowadays microplate readers have controls regulated by \nmicroprocessors; connection interfaces to information systems; quality and process control programs, which by means of a computer, allow complete test automation.Chapter 1\nMicroplate Reader\nGMDN Code 37036\nECRI Code 16-979\nDenomination Photometric micro-plate reader\nPhoto courtesy of BioRad Laboratories CHAPTER 1  MICROPLATE READER\n2Equipment required for ELISA testing\nIn order to perform the ELISA technique, the following \nequipment is r equired:  \n1.

In the laboratory, the balance is used \nfor weighing as part of quality control activities (on devices like pipettes), in the preparation of mixtures of components in predefined proportions and in the determination of specifi  c densities or weights. OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThere are diff  erences in design, principles and criteria of \nmetrology amongst balances. At present, there are two large groups of balances: mechanical and electronic balances. Mechanical balances \nThe following are some of the more common ones: 1. Spring balance. Its function is based on a mechanical \nproperty of springs as the force exercised on a spring is proportional to the spring\u2019s elasticity constant [k], multiplied by its elongation [x] [F = -kx]. The greater the mass [m] placed on the balance\u2019s plate, the greater the elongation will be, given that the elongation is proportional to the mass and the spring\u2019s constant. The calibration of a spring balance depends on the force of gravity acting on the object weighed. This type of balance is used when great precision is not necessary. 2. Sliding weight balance. This type of balance is \nequipped with two known weights which can be moved on setting scales (one macro, the other micro). Upon placing a substance of unknown mass on the tray, its weight is determined by moving the weight on both setting scales until the equilibrium position is reached. At this point, the weight is obtained by adding both quantities indicated by the sliding masses\u2019 position on the scale. 3. Analytical balance. This balance functions by comparing \nknown weight masses with that of a substance of unknown weight. It is composed of a base on a bar or symmetrical lever, maintained by a blade-like support on a central point called a fulcrum. At its ends, there are stirrups, also supported with blades which allow these to oscillate smoothly. From there, two plates are suspended. Certifi  ed weights are placed on one \nof the plates and unknown weights on the other. The balance has a securing system or lock, which allows the main lever to remain stable when not in use or when it is necessary to modify the counter-weights. The balance is inside an external box which protects it from interferences, such as air currents. Analytical balances can weigh ten thousandths of a gram (0.0001 g) or 100 thousandths of a gram (0.00001 g). This type of balance generally has a capacity of up to 200 grams.

The requirement with this type of mechanism is that parallel guides must be maintained with exactitude of up to \u00b1 1  \u00b5m.

These syringes are selected and installed in the dilutor depending on the densities, viscosities, and volumes of fluids to be manipulated. The fluids are transported through flexible tubes, whose diameters, lengths and chemical compatibility are taken into account in the design and manufacturing process for suitability with the selected activity. These tubes are linked using connections manually adjustable. Normally, the syringes are classifi  ed according to \ntheir use (e.g. syringes for reagents, diluents, samples), and the volume these manipulate. The following table shows an example of how they are classifi  ed according to their size \nand managed volumes. Opposite, the components of the dispensing system (syringe \nand dispenser) are shown. INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS\nThe dilutor must be installed on a clean, dry and extremely levelled counter or work surface, far from areas where there \nmay be vapours which can aff  ect its functioning. There must be free space around the equipment for \nfacilitating ventilation and the passage of cables and interconnection lines and cables with the solvent containers, computers or supply systems.

In the laboratory, the balance is used \nfor weighing as part of quality control activities (on devices like pipettes), in the preparation of mixtures of components in predefined proportions and in the determination of specifi  c densities or weights. OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThere are diff  erences in design, principles and criteria of \nmetrology amongst balances. At present, there are two large groups of balances: mechanical and electronic balances. Mechanical balances \nThe following are some of the more common ones: 1. Spring balance. Its function is based on a mechanical \nproperty of springs as the force exercised on a spring is proportional to the spring\u2019s elasticity constant [k], multiplied by its elongation [x] [F = -kx]. The greater the mass [m] placed on the balance\u2019s plate, the greater the elongation will be, given that the elongation is proportional to the mass and the spring\u2019s constant. The calibration of a spring balance depends on the force of gravity acting on the object weighed. This type of balance is used when great precision is not necessary. 2. Sliding weight balance. This type of balance is \nequipped with two known weights which can be moved on setting scales (one macro, the other micro). Upon placing a substance of unknown mass on the tray, its weight is determined by moving the weight on both setting scales until the equilibrium position is reached. At this point, the weight is obtained by adding both quantities indicated by the sliding masses\u2019 position on the scale. 3. Analytical balance. This balance functions by comparing \nknown weight masses with that of a substance of unknown weight. It is composed of a base on a bar or symmetrical lever, maintained by a blade-like support on a central point called a fulcrum. At its ends, there are stirrups, also supported with blades which allow these to oscillate smoothly. From there, two plates are suspended. Certifi  ed weights are placed on one \nof the plates and unknown weights on the other. The balance has a securing system or lock, which allows the main lever to remain stable when not in use or when it is necessary to modify the counter-weights. The balance is inside an external box which protects it from interferences, such as air currents. Analytical balances can weigh ten thousandths of a gram (0.0001 g) or 100 thousandths of a gram (0.00001 g). This type of balance generally has a capacity of up to 200 grams.

These syringes are selected and installed in the dilutor depending on the densities, viscosities, and volumes of fluids to be manipulated.

These tubes are linked using connections manually adjustable.

Substitution Balance (Unequal-lever arm or two-\nknife balance). This is a balance with a single plate. An unknown mass is placed on the weighing plate. It is weighed by removing known masses from the counterweight side until it reaches a balanced position, using a mechanical system of cams. The fulcrum is generally off  -centre in relation to the length of the load \nbeam and located near the front of the balance. When a mass is placed on the weight plate and the balance\u2019s locking mechanism is released, the movement of the load beam is projected through an optical system to a screen located on the front part of the instrument. Operation veri\ufb01  cation\nThe procedure used for verifying the functioning of a typical \nmechanical balanc e is described below. The described \nprocess is based on the substitution balance.1. Verify that the balance is levelled. The levelling is \nachieved using a ring-shaped adjustment mechanism located on the base of the balance or by adjusting a bubble or knob on a scale located on the front of the balance\u2019s base. 2. Test the  zero mechanism. Place the controls on zero \nand free the balance. If the reading does not stay at zero, adjust the zero mechanism (a grooved screw located in a horizontal position near the fulcrum). To do this, it is necessary to block the balance and slightly adjust the mechanism. The process is to be continued until the zero adjusts correctly on the reading scale.3. Verify and adjust the sensitivity. This is always readjusted \nwhenever some internal adjustment is done. It is performed with a known standard according to the following steps:\na) Lock the balance.b) Place a standard weight (equivalent to the optical \nscale range) on the plate. c) Position the micro setting to one (1). d) Release the balance. e) Adjust to the zero position.f) Position the micro setting to zero (0). The balance \nshould indicate 100. If the scale displays less or more than 100, the sensitivity control must be adjusted. This requires locking the balance, opening the upper cover and turning the sensitivity screw: If the scale registers more than 100; turn the screw in a clockwise position. If the scale registers less than 100, it is necessary to unwind the screw anticlockwise. Repeat the process until the balance is adjusted (adjusting the zero and the sensitivity).Type of mass Capacity\nSimple pieces \n 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 g \n100, 200 and 500 g \nFractional pieces \n 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 mg \n100, 200 and 500 mg \nMass\nPlate\nFlexible\nConnections\nSupport ColumnFGFigure 10.

If the instrument does not have a calibration plate, verify \nit by placing a coloured solution in the wells of a plate and immediately carry out a complete reading. Then invert the plate 180\u00b0 and read the plate again. If both readings display identical, average values in each row, the reader is calibrated. 5. Verify that the reader is calibrated, column by column. Place a clean, empty plate and carry out a reading. If there is no diff  erence between each of the average \nreading of the fi  rst to the last column, it can be assumed \nthat the reader is calibrated.

The \ncentrifuge is designed to use the centrifugal force generated in rotational movements to separate the constitutive elements of a mixture. There is a wide range of centrifuges capable of serving specifi  c industry and research needs. This \nchapter focuses on standing centrifuges normally used in public health and clinical laboratories. PHOTOGRAPH OF CENTRIFUGEPURPOSE OF THE CENTRIFUGE\nThe centrifuge uses centrifugal force (the force generated \nwhen an objec t rotates around a single point), for separating \nsolids suspended in a liquid by sedimentation, or liquids of diverse density. The rotational movements allow forces much greater than gravity to be generated in controlled periods of time. In the laboratory, centrifuges are generally used in processes such as the separation of solid components from biological liquids through sedimentation and in particular of blood components: red cells, white cells, platelets among others and for conducting multiple tests and treatments.There are several kinds of centrifuges. The most widely used in public health, surveillance and clinical laboratories are the table-top centrifuge, the ultracentrifuge, the haeamatocrit centrifuge and the standing centrifuge. OPERATION PRINCIPLES \nCentrifuges represent a practical application of Newton\u2019s law of motion. When a body of mass [m] turns around \na central point [O], it is subjected to a centripetal  force \n[N] directed towards the rotation axis with a magnitude N = m\u03c9\n2R, where [m] is the mass of the body, [R] is the radius \nand \u03c9 is the angular speed. Centrifuges possess a rotating axis on which is mounted a rotor with sample receiving compartments. Tangential speed is defi  ned by the following \nequation: VT=\u03c9R. Photo courtesy of Beckman CoulterCHAPTER 7  CENTRIFUGE\n46When the system spins at a speed of \u03c9 radians per second, \nthe samples are subjected to the centrifugal force Fp of the \nsame magnitude as N, but in an opposite direction. The \nfi gure shown below1 features a diagram of the concept, \nof its actual application and of the obtained result. This Fp force acts on particles in the substance centrifuged, \ncausing them to separate as a result of diff  erences in density. Denser particles will settle at the bottom of the tube in shorter periods of time, while lighter ones require longer periods of time, settling onto those of greater density. The relationship between the centrifugal acceleration [\u03c9\n2r ] to a \ngiven radius [r] and the force of gravity [g] is known as the relative centrifugal fi  eld or [RCF]\n2. RCF =r\u03c92\ng\nThe RCF is the tool which allows rotors of different \nspecifi  cations to be compared when equivalent centrifugal \neff ects are required. COMPONENTS OF THE CENTRIFUGE \nThe most important components of a centrifuge are the \nfollowing3:\nThe electric\/electronic control which generally has the following elements:1. On and off control, operation time control (timer), \nrotation speed control (in some centrifuges), temperature control (in refrigerated centrifuges), vibration control (safety mechanism) and brake system.2. Refrigeration system (in refrigerated centrifuges). 3. Vacuum system (in ultracentrifuges, not shown in the \nfi gure). 4.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>5. Substitution Balance (Unequal-lever arm or two-\nknife balance). This is a balance with a single plate. An unknown mass is placed on the weighing plate. It is weighed by removing known masses from the counterweight side until it reaches a balanced position, using a mechanical system of cams. The fulcrum is generally off  -centre in relation to the length of the load \nbeam and located near the front of the balance. When a mass is placed on the weight plate and the balance\u2019s locking mechanism is released, the movement of the load beam is projected through an optical system to a screen located on the front part of the instrument. Operation veri\ufb01  cation\nThe procedure used for verifying the functioning of a typical \nmechanical balanc e is described below. The described \nprocess is based on the substitution balance.1. Verify that the balance is levelled. The levelling is \nachieved using a ring-shaped adjustment mechanism located on the base of the balance or by adjusting a bubble or knob on a scale located on the front of the balance\u2019s base. 2. Test the  zero mechanism. Place the controls on zero \nand free the balance. If the reading does not stay at zero, adjust the zero mechanism (a grooved screw located in a horizontal position near the fulcrum). To do this, it is necessary to block the balance and slightly adjust the mechanism. The process is to be continued until the zero adjusts correctly on the reading scale.3. Verify and adjust the sensitivity. This is always readjusted \nwhenever some internal adjustment is done. It is performed with a known standard according to the following steps:\na) Lock the balance.b) Place a standard weight (equivalent to the optical \nscale range) on the plate. c) Position the micro setting to one (1). d) Release the balance. e) Adjust to the zero position.f) Position the micro setting to zero (0). The balance \nshould indicate 100. If the scale displays less or more than 100, the sensitivity control must be adjusted. This requires locking the balance, opening the upper cover and turning the sensitivity screw: If the scale registers more than 100; turn the screw in a clockwise position. If the scale registers less than 100, it is necessary to unwind the screw anticlockwise. Repeat the process until the balance is adjusted (adjusting the zero and the sensitivity).Type of mass Capacity\nSimple pieces \n 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 g \n100, 200 and 500 g \nFractional pieces \n 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 mg \n100, 200 and 500 mg \nMass\nPlate\nFlexible\nConnections\nSupport ColumnFGFigure 10.

A digital analogous electronic circuit shows the fi  nal \nresult of the weight digitally. Laboratory balances operate according to the principle \nof compensation of the electromagnetic force applicable to displacements or torques. The combination of their mechanical components and automatic reading systems provides weight measurements at defi  ned levels of accuracy \ndepending on the model. Principle. The mobile parts (weighing plate, support \ncolumn [a], bobbin, position and load indicator [G] -the object in the process of being weighed-) are maintained in equilibrium by a compensation force [F] equal to the weight. The compensation force is generated by an electrical current through a bobbin in the air gap of a cylindrical electromagnet. The force F is calculated with the equation [F = I x L x B] where: I = electrical intensity, L = total length of the wire of the coil and B = magnetic fl  ow intensity in the \nelectromagnet\u2019s air gap.With any change in the load (weight\/mass), the mobile \nmechanical system responds by moving vertically a fraction of distance. Detected by a photosensor [e], an electrical signal is sent to the servo-amplifi  er [f]. This changes the \nfl ow of electrical current passing through the bobbin of the \nmagnet [c] in such a manner that the mobile system returns to the balanced position upon adjusting of the magnetic fl ow in the electromagnet. Consequently, the weight of \nthe mass [G] can be measured indirectly at the start of the electrical current fl  ow, which passes through the circuit \nmeasuring the voltage [V] by means of a precision resistor [R], [V = I x R]. To date, many systems developed use the electronic system for carrying out very exact measurements of mass and weight. The following diagram explains how electronic balances function.

The signal process comprises the following functions:1. Tare setting. This setting is used to adjust the reading \nvalue at zero with any load within the balance\u2019s capacity range. It is controlled by a button generally located on the front part of the balance. It is commonly used for taring the weighing container. 2. Repeatability setting control. During a reading, weighed \nvalues are averaged within a predefi  ned period of time. This function is very useful when weighing operations need to be carried out in unstable conditions, e.g. in the presence of air currents or vibrations. This control defi nes the time period allowed for a result to lie within \npreset limits for it to be considered stable.

A solution containing either a weak acid and its salt or, a weak base and its salt, which makes it resistant to changes in pH at a given temperature. PBS. One of the solutions used to perform washing operations in ELISA tests. PBS is the acronym for Phosphate Buff  er Solution. This  is made of the following \nsubstances: NaCl, KCl, NaHPO42H2O and KH2SO4. The manufacturers supply technical bulletins which indicate the proportions and instructions for preparing PBS. In \ngeneral, one part of concentrated PBS is mixed with 19 parts of deionised water. Plate (ELISA). Consumable with standard dimensions, designed to hold samples and reactions for the ELISA technique. In general, these have 96 , 384 or 1536 wells \nand are made of plastics such as polystyrene and polypropylene. There are plates specially treated to facilitate the performanc e of the tests. Positive displacement pump. A pump adjusted by a plunger moving along a cylinder. The mechanism is similar to that of a syringe. It is equipped with a set  of \nvalves for controlling the fl  ow to and from the pump. TMB\/H2O2.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>The balance has other names \nsuch as scale and weight. It must be taken into account that the weight is the force which the gravitational fi  eld exercises on a body\u2019s mass, this force being the product of the mass \nby the local acceleration of gravity [F = m x g]. The term local is used to emphasize that this acceleration depends on factors such as the geographical latitude, altitude and the Earth\u2019s density where the measurement is taken. This force is measured in Newtons.

In the laboratory, the balance is used \nfor weighing as part of quality control activities (on devices like pipettes), in the preparation of mixtures of components in predefined proportions and in the determination of specifi  c densities or weights. OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThere are diff  erences in design, principles and criteria of \nmetrology amongst balances. At present, there are two large groups of balances: mechanical and electronic balances. Mechanical balances \nThe following are some of the more common ones: 1. Spring balance. Its function is based on a mechanical \nproperty of springs as the force exercised on a spring is proportional to the spring\u2019s elasticity constant [k], multiplied by its elongation [x] [F = -kx]. The greater the mass [m] placed on the balance\u2019s plate, the greater the elongation will be, given that the elongation is proportional to the mass and the spring\u2019s constant. The calibration of a spring balance depends on the force of gravity acting on the object weighed. This type of balance is used when great precision is not necessary. 2. Sliding weight balance. This type of balance is \nequipped with two known weights which can be moved on setting scales (one macro, the other micro). Upon placing a substance of unknown mass on the tray, its weight is determined by moving the weight on both setting scales until the equilibrium position is reached. At this point, the weight is obtained by adding both quantities indicated by the sliding masses\u2019 position on the scale. 3. Analytical balance. This balance functions by comparing \nknown weight masses with that of a substance of unknown weight. It is composed of a base on a bar or symmetrical lever, maintained by a blade-like support on a central point called a fulcrum. At its ends, there are stirrups, also supported with blades which allow these to oscillate smoothly. From there, two plates are suspended. Certifi  ed weights are placed on one \nof the plates and unknown weights on the other. The balance has a securing system or lock, which allows the main lever to remain stable when not in use or when it is necessary to modify the counter-weights. The balance is inside an external box which protects it from interferences, such as air currents. Analytical balances can weigh ten thousandths of a gram (0.0001 g) or 100 thousandths of a gram (0.00001 g). This type of balance generally has a capacity of up to 200 grams.

Analytical balance  MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n23It is necessary to have a set of certifi  ed masses. The set is \ngenerally composed of the following pieces:\n4. Upper plate balance (Top loading or parallel guidance \nbalance). This type of balance has a loading plate located \non its upper part, supported by a column maintained in a vertical position by two pairs of guides with fl  exible \nconnections. The eff  ect of the force produced by the \nmass is transmitted from a point on the vertical column directly or by some mechanical means to the loading cell. The requirement with this type of mechanism is that parallel guides must be maintained with exactitude of up to \u00b1 1  \u00b5m. Deviations in parallelism cause an error known \nas lateral load (when the mass being weighed shows diff erences if the reading is taken at the centre of the \nplate or on one of its sides). The diagram shown below explains the operation principle some manufacturers have introduced in electronic balances.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>(High individual risk, high community risk). INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS\nThe following are requirements for a cabinet to function adequat ely: \n1. A laboratory area protected from air currents from \nwindows or air-conditioning systems. The cabinet must also be located far from the laboratory circulation zones in order to avoid air currents that could affect the curtain of air inside the cabinet. It must also be verifi  ed \nthat the cabinet is not installed alongside other types of cabinets such as chemical hoods. 2. An electrical connection equipped with the respective \ncontrol and safety elements; the electrical outlet with a ground pole. 3. A levelled and fi  rm table designed for supporting the \nweight of the cabinet and allowing the operator to work comfortably. There must be free space for placing the feet and its height must be adequate.4. The floor on which it is located must be flat and \nlevelled. 5. The free space around the cabinet recommended by the \nmanufacturer must be respected. Likewise, the height of the room must be verifi  ed (the ceiling must be of \nrecommended height so that it can function without hindrance). 6. Type B cabinets must have an extraction duct equipped \nwith the following required control devices: regulating valves that allow the flow of air to be isolated and regulated. 7. Gas connections must be in the immediate vicinity of \nthe cabinet in order to facilitate the connection to these service valves. 8.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>On the outside and end of the inner tube is the anodized end. The reference electrode is usually made of the same type of material as the internal electrode. Both tubes, interior and exterior, contain a reference solution. Only the outer tube has contact with the measured solution through a porous cap which acts as a saline bridge. This device acts like a galvanized cell. The reference electrode \nis the internal tube of the pH meter probe, which cannot lose ions through interactions with the surrounding environment. Therefore as a reference, it remains static (unchangeable) during the measuring process. The external tube of the probe contains the medium which is allowed  to mix with the external environment. As a result, this tube must be fi lled periodically with a potassium chloride solution (KCI) \nfor restoring the capacity of the electrode which would otherwise be inhibited by a loss of ions and evaporation. The glass bulb on the lower part of the pH electrode acts \nas a measuring element and is covered with a layer of hydrated gel on its exterior and interior. Metallic sodium cations [Na\n+] are diff  used in the hydrated gel outside of \nthe glass and in the solution, while the hydrogen ions [H+] \nare diff  used in the gel. This gel makes the pH electrode \nion-selective:  Hydrogen ions [H+] cannot pass through the \nglass membrane of the pH electrode. Sodium ions [Na+] pass \nthrough and cause a change in free energy, which the pH meter measures. A brief explanation of the theory on how electrodes function is included in the appendix at the end of the chapter.pH METER COMPONENTS \nA pH meter generally has the following components: 1. The body of the instrument containing the circuits, \ncontrols, connectors, display screens and measuring scales. The following are among some of its most \nimportant components:\na) An ON and OFF switch. Not all pH meters have an \non and off   switch. Some simply have a cord with a \nplug which allows it to be connected to a suitable electrical outlet. b) Temperature control. This control allows \nadjustments according to the temperature of the solution measured. c) Calibration controls. Depending on the design, \npH meters possess one or two calibration buttons or dials. Normally these are identifi  ed by Cal 1  and \nCal 2 . If the pH meter is calibrated using only one \nsolution, the Cal 1 button is used; making sure that Cal 2 is set at a 100%. If the pH meter allows  two point calibrations, two known pH solutions covering the range of pH to be measured are used. In this case, the two controls are used (Cal 1 and Cal 2). In special cases, a three-point calibration must be done (using three known pH solutions). d) Mode selector.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>5. Substitution Balance (Unequal-lever arm or two-\nknife balance). This is a balance with a single plate. An unknown mass is placed on the weighing plate. It is weighed by removing known masses from the counterweight side until it reaches a balanced position, using a mechanical system of cams. The fulcrum is generally off  -centre in relation to the length of the load \nbeam and located near the front of the balance. When a mass is placed on the weight plate and the balance\u2019s locking mechanism is released, the movement of the load beam is projected through an optical system to a screen located on the front part of the instrument. Operation veri\ufb01  cation\nThe procedure used for verifying the functioning of a typical \nmechanical balanc e is described below. The described \nprocess is based on the substitution balance.1. Verify that the balance is levelled. The levelling is \nachieved using a ring-shaped adjustment mechanism located on the base of the balance or by adjusting a bubble or knob on a scale located on the front of the balance\u2019s base. 2. Test the  zero mechanism. Place the controls on zero \nand free the balance. If the reading does not stay at zero, adjust the zero mechanism (a grooved screw located in a horizontal position near the fulcrum). To do this, it is necessary to block the balance and slightly adjust the mechanism. The process is to be continued until the zero adjusts correctly on the reading scale.3. Verify and adjust the sensitivity. This is always readjusted \nwhenever some internal adjustment is done. It is performed with a known standard according to the following steps:\na) Lock the balance.b) Place a standard weight (equivalent to the optical \nscale range) on the plate. c) Position the micro setting to one (1). d) Release the balance. e) Adjust to the zero position.f) Position the micro setting to zero (0). The balance \nshould indicate 100. If the scale displays less or more than 100, the sensitivity control must be adjusted. This requires locking the balance, opening the upper cover and turning the sensitivity screw: If the scale registers more than 100; turn the screw in a clockwise position. If the scale registers less than 100, it is necessary to unwind the screw anticlockwise. Repeat the process until the balance is adjusted (adjusting the zero and the sensitivity).Type of mass Capacity\nSimple pieces \n 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 g \n100, 200 and 500 g \nFractional pieces \n 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 mg \n100, 200 and 500 mg \nMass\nPlate\nFlexible\nConnections\nSupport ColumnFGFigure 10.

Device located at the bottom of the water bath to support the containers located inside the tank. It also allows thermal conve ction currents generated \nin the fl  uid contained in the tank to circulate from top to bottom and back to the top, maintaining the temperature homogeneous  at the level selected by the operator. In general the diff  using tray is made of stainless steel. Electrostatic painting. A painting process that uses the particle-attracting property of electrostatic charges. A potential diff  erence of 80-150kV is applied to a \ngrid of wires through which the paint is sprayed to charge each particle. The metal objects to be sprayed are connected to the opposite terminal of the high-voltage \ncircuit, so that they attract the particles of paint. The piece covered with paint particles is then placed in an electrical ov en to melt the particles, making them adhere \nstrongly to the piece. Fuse. A safety device which protects the electrical circuits from excessive current. Fuses are made of materials whose dimensions an d properties equip them to \nwork well within some predefi  ned conditions. If for some reason the design parameters are exceeded, the material burns out and interrupts the passage of the \nelectrical current. Immersion resistor . An electrical resistor (see defi  nition below) inside of a sealed tube. These are generally used for heating fl  uids as water o r oil. Resistance. Opposition that a material or electrical circuit imposes to the fl  ow of electric current. It is the property of a circuit that  transforms electrical energy \ninto heat as it opposes the fl  ow of current. The resistance [R], of a body of uniform section such as a wire, is directly propo rtional to the length [l] and inversely \nproportional to the sectional area [a]. The resistance is calculated by the following equation:\nR=k\u00d7l\na\nWhere: \nk  = constant that depends on the units employed \nl  = Length of the conductor a  = sectional area of the conductor \nThe ohm (\u03a9) is the common unit of electrical resistance; one ohm is equal to one volt per ampere.MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n35Chapter 6\nBiological Safety Cabinet\nThis equipment is designed for controlling aerosols and \nmicroparticles associated with managing potentially toxic or infectious biological material in laboratories in activities such as agitation, centrifugation, pipetting, and opening of pressurized containers.

The pressure decreases until it reaches the vapour pre ssure of the fl  uid. This produces diverse phenomena such as vaporization of gases dissolved in the liquid or, in the case of water, the formation o f vapour bubbles collapsing after an \ninfi  nitesimal time lapse, perforating the surfaces of conducts in the immediate vicinity. This occurs in dilutors when using la rge capacity syringes with elevated \npropulsion speed. Concentration. A quantity measurement of a chemical substance present in a solution. The concept is expressed as the quantity of a substance dissolved into a \nsolvent. Concentration is expressed in diverse forms; the most common are: molarity [M], molality [m], normality [N], percentag e rate of solute. Dilution. To reduce the concentration of a solution by adding other fl  uids. The fl  uid added is known as the diluent . Adding the molecules of a liquid substance with \nthe molecules of another liquid substance. In order to determine the volume V1 of liquid needed to obtain V2 volume at a concen tration C2 from a stock solution of \nconcentration C1, the following equation is used:  \nDispenser.

PHOTOGRAPH OF MICROPLATE WASHER \nPURPOSE OF THE MICROPLATE WASHER \nThe microplate washer has been designed to supply cleaning \nbuff ers required for the ELISA technique in a controlled \nmanner. In the same fashion, the equipment removes from each well, substances in excess from the reaction. Depending on the test performed, the washer can intervene from one to four times, supplying the washing buff  er, agitating and \nremoving the unbound reagents\n1 until the programmed \ntimes and cycles are completed. The washer has of two reservoirs; one for the washing buff  er, the other for the waste \ngenerated during the washing process.OPERATION PRINCIPLES \nThe microplate washer has been designed to perform washing operations in the ELISA t echnique. The equipment \npossesses at least, the following subsystems which vary depending on the manufacturer\u2019s design. \u2022\u2022 Control subsystem. Generally , the washer is controlled \nby microprocessors allowing programming and controlling steps to be performed by the washer such as: number of washing cycles\n2 (1\u20135); expected times; \nsupplying and extracting pressures; plate format (96\u2013384 wells); suction function adjustment according to the type of well\n3 (fl at bottom, V bottom or rounded \nbottom or strips used); volumes distributed or aspirated; the soaking and agitation cycles, etc. \u2022\u2022 Supply subsystem. In general, this comprises a reservoir \nfor the washing solution; one or several pumps; usually a positive displacement type syringe and a dispenser head that supplies the washing solution to the diff  erent \nwells by means of needles. The head usually comes with eight pairs of needles for washing and aspirating simultaneously the wells of the same row (the supply and extraction sub-systems converge on the head). There are models with twelve pairs of needles and others that conduct the washing process simultaneously in all the wells. Some washers off  er the possibility of working \nwith diff  erent types of washing solutions, performing \nthe solution changes according to the program entered by the operator. 1 See a brief explication of the ELISA technique in Chapter 1, Microplate \nReader . 2 The exact number of washing operations required depends on the assay \nused.<\/DOCUMENT>\n1.

Dilutor controls    MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n61\nDispenser system\nThe dispenser system is composed of a set of high precision \nsyringes and devic es called dispensers, through which \nfl uids are supplied according to their volumes and selected \nvelocities. These syringes are selected and installed in the dilutor depending on the densities, viscosities, and volumes of fluids to be manipulated. The fluids are transported through flexible tubes, whose diameters, lengths and chemical compatibility are taken into account in the design and manufacturing process for suitability with the selected activity. These tubes are linked using connections manually adjustable. Normally, the syringes are classifi  ed according to \ntheir use (e.g. syringes for reagents, diluents, samples), and the volume these manipulate. The following table shows an example of how they are classifi  ed according to their size \nand managed volumes. Opposite, the components of the dispensing system (syringe \nand dispenser) are shown. INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS\nThe dilutor must be installed on a clean, dry and extremely levelled counter or work surface, far from areas where there \nmay be vapours which can aff  ect its functioning. There must be free space around the equipment for \nfacilitating ventilation and the passage of cables and interconnection lines and cables with the solvent containers, computers or supply systems. The space around the dilutor should be approximately 10 cm. There must be a 115 V, 60 Hz electrical outlet in good \ncondition with a ground pole or alternatively one of 220\u2013240 V, 50\/60 Hz, depending on the manufacturer\u2019s specifi  cations \nand\/or the electrical norms in the country of use.ROUTINE MAINTENANCE \nThe routine maintenance focuses mainly on eliminating contaminants which may accumulate inside the fluid \nmechanisms and\/or lines. The most common routines are the following:\nCleaning of exterior surfaces\nFrequency: Daily\nWarning:  Disconnect the dilutor from the electrical feed \noutlet before beginning the external cleaning process. 1. Clean the exterior surfaces using a clean piece of cloth \ndampened with a mild detergent mixed with water. 2. Lightly rub the surfaces of the dilutor and the \naccessories. 3.

The diff  erence in the results when the load in the balance is increased or decreased. Lateral load. A balance\u2019s ability to consistently read the value of masses, no matter where they are placed on the weighing scale. This is a lso called corner load. Lateral load error. A deviation in the results when an object is weighed placing it in diff  erent parts of the weighing plate, i.e. in the centre o f the plate and on \none of its sides. Linear error. A diff  erence showed when the balance is loaded in a successive manner, increasing the quantity of weight in equal magnitude un til it reaches its \nmaximum capacity and unloaded in an analogous process. The diff  erences shown between the readings obtained and the arithmetic v alues corresponding to the \nweights used are interpreted as non-linearity. Linearity. Refers to the ability of a balance to perform  accurate readings of weights throughout its weighing capacity . A graph showing  weight compared to the \nweight indication on a perfectly linear balance should generate a straight line. In order to determine the linear error of a ba lance, certifi  ed masses must be used. The procedure allows the linear diff  erences to be calculated by reading certifi  ed masses with and without preloading. The diff  e rence between the readings allows \nthe linear error to be calculated. Mass.

In the laboratory, the balance is used \nfor weighing as part of quality control activities (on devices like pipettes), in the preparation of mixtures of components in predefined proportions and in the determination of specifi  c densities or weights. OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThere are diff  erences in design, principles and criteria of \nmetrology amongst balances. At present, there are two large groups of balances: mechanical and electronic balances. Mechanical balances \nThe following are some of the more common ones: 1. Spring balance. Its function is based on a mechanical \nproperty of springs as the force exercised on a spring is proportional to the spring\u2019s elasticity constant [k], multiplied by its elongation [x] [F = -kx]. The greater the mass [m] placed on the balance\u2019s plate, the greater the elongation will be, given that the elongation is proportional to the mass and the spring\u2019s constant. The calibration of a spring balance depends on the force of gravity acting on the object weighed. This type of balance is used when great precision is not necessary. 2. Sliding weight balance. This type of balance is \nequipped with two known weights which can be moved on setting scales (one macro, the other micro). Upon placing a substance of unknown mass on the tray, its weight is determined by moving the weight on both setting scales until the equilibrium position is reached. At this point, the weight is obtained by adding both quantities indicated by the sliding masses\u2019 position on the scale. 3. Analytical balance. This balance functions by comparing \nknown weight masses with that of a substance of unknown weight. It is composed of a base on a bar or symmetrical lever, maintained by a blade-like support on a central point called a fulcrum. At its ends, there are stirrups, also supported with blades which allow these to oscillate smoothly. From there, two plates are suspended. Certifi  ed weights are placed on one \nof the plates and unknown weights on the other. The balance has a securing system or lock, which allows the main lever to remain stable when not in use or when it is necessary to modify the counter-weights. The balance is inside an external box which protects it from interferences, such as air currents. Analytical balances can weigh ten thousandths of a gram (0.0001 g) or 100 thousandths of a gram (0.00001 g). This type of balance generally has a capacity of up to 200 grams.

Upper plate balance (Top loading or parallel guidance \nbalance). This type of balance has a loading plate located \non its upper part, supported by a column maintained in a vertical position by two pairs of guides with fl  exible \nconnections. The eff  ect of the force produced by the \nmass is transmitted from a point on the vertical column directly or by some mechanical means to the loading cell. The requirement with this type of mechanism is that parallel guides must be maintained with exactitude of up to \u00b1 1  \u00b5m. Deviations in parallelism cause an error known \nas lateral load (when the mass being weighed shows diff erences if the reading is taken at the centre of the \nplate or on one of its sides).

The technique \nis based on the detection of an antigen or antibodies captured on a solid surface using direct or secondary, labelled antibodies, producing a reaction whose product can be read by the spectrophotometer. The word ELISA is the acronym for \u201cEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay\u201d . This chapter covers the use of microplate readers for ELISA testing. For additional information on the instrument principles of operation and maintenance, consult Chapter 11 discussing the spectrophotometer. PHOTOGRAPH OF MICROPLATE READER\nPURPOSE OF THE MICROPLATE READER\nThe microplate reader is used for reading the results of ELISA \ntests. This technique has a direct application in immunology and serology. Among other applications it confi  rms the \npresence of antibodies or antigens of an infectious agent in an organism, antibodies from a vaccine or auto-antibodies, for example in rheumatoid arthritis.OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThe microplate reader is a specialized spectrophotometer. Unlike the c onventional spectrophotometer which facilitates \nreadings on a wide range of wavelengths, the microplate reader has filters or diffraction gratings that limit the wavelength range to that used in ELISA, generally between 400 to 750 nm (nanometres). Some readers operate in the ultraviolet range and carry out analyses between 340 to 700 nm. The optical system exploited by many manufacturers uses optic fi  bres to supply light to the microplate wells \ncontaining the samples. The light beam, passing through the sample has a diameter ranging between 1 to 3 mm. A detection system detects the light coming from the sample, amplifi  es the signal and determines the sample\u2019s \nabsorbance. A reading system converts it into data allowing the test result interpretation. Some microplate readers use double beam light systems. Test samples are located in specially designed plates with \na specifi  c number of wells where the procedure or test is \ncarried out. Plates of 8 columns by 12 rows with a total of 96 wells are common. There are also plates with a greater number of wells. For specialized applications, the current trend is to increase the number of wells (384-well plates) to reduce the amount of reagents and samples used and a greater throughput. The location of the optical sensors of the microplate reader varies depending on the manufacturers: these can be located above the sample plate, or directly underneath the plate\u2019s wells. Nowadays microplate readers have controls regulated by \nmicroprocessors; connection interfaces to information systems; quality and process control programs, which by means of a computer, allow complete test automation.Chapter 1\nMicroplate Reader\nGMDN Code 37036\nECRI Code 16-979\nDenomination Photometric micro-plate reader\nPhoto courtesy of BioRad Laboratories CHAPTER 1  MICROPLATE READER\n2Equipment required for ELISA testing\nIn order to perform the ELISA technique, the following \nequipment is r equired:  \n1.

The pressure\u2019s integral part \non the area allows the force to be calculated.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>On the outside and end of the inner tube is the anodized end. The reference electrode is usually made of the same type of material as the internal electrode. Both tubes, interior and exterior, contain a reference solution. Only the outer tube has contact with the measured solution through a porous cap which acts as a saline bridge. This device acts like a galvanized cell. The reference electrode \nis the internal tube of the pH meter probe, which cannot lose ions through interactions with the surrounding environment. Therefore as a reference, it remains static (unchangeable) during the measuring process. The external tube of the probe contains the medium which is allowed  to mix with the external environment. As a result, this tube must be fi lled periodically with a potassium chloride solution (KCI) \nfor restoring the capacity of the electrode which would otherwise be inhibited by a loss of ions and evaporation. The glass bulb on the lower part of the pH electrode acts \nas a measuring element and is covered with a layer of hydrated gel on its exterior and interior. Metallic sodium cations [Na\n+] are diff  used in the hydrated gel outside of \nthe glass and in the solution, while the hydrogen ions [H+] \nare diff  used in the gel. This gel makes the pH electrode \nion-selective:  Hydrogen ions [H+] cannot pass through the \nglass membrane of the pH electrode. Sodium ions [Na+] pass \nthrough and cause a change in free energy, which the pH meter measures. A brief explanation of the theory on how electrodes function is included in the appendix at the end of the chapter.pH METER COMPONENTS \nA pH meter generally has the following components: 1. The body of the instrument containing the circuits, \ncontrols, connectors, display screens and measuring scales. The following are among some of its most \nimportant components:\na) An ON and OFF switch. Not all pH meters have an \non and off   switch. Some simply have a cord with a \nplug which allows it to be connected to a suitable electrical outlet. b) Temperature control. This control allows \nadjustments according to the temperature of the solution measured. c) Calibration controls. Depending on the design, \npH meters possess one or two calibration buttons or dials. Normally these are identifi  ed by Cal 1  and \nCal 2 . If the pH meter is calibrated using only one \nsolution, the Cal 1 button is used; making sure that Cal 2 is set at a 100%. If the pH meter allows  two point calibrations, two known pH solutions covering the range of pH to be measured are used. In this case, the two controls are used (Cal 1 and Cal 2). In special cases, a three-point calibration must be done (using three known pH solutions). d) Mode selector.<\/DOCUMENT>\n4.

Likewise, the space required for cables such as the interconnection, electrical current cables and the information system connection to the printer must be anticipated. 3. Avoid installing equipment which produces elevated \nmagnetic fi  elds or vibrations like centrifuges, electrical \nmotors, compressors and generators in its vicinity. 4.

In \ngeneral, it must conform to the following procedure:1. Allow the balance to equilibrate with the environment \nwhere it is installed. 2. Allow the balance to warm-up before initiating activities. Normally it is suffi   cient to have it connected to the \nelectrical feed system. Some manufacturers suggest at least 20 minutes from the moment it is energized until use. Analytical balances Class 1 require at least 2 hours for warming before initiating use. Verify that the balance is calibrated. Electronic \nbalances generally have a factory-made calibration stored in memory which can be used if it does not have calibration masses. If calibration is required, use calibrated masses as indicated by the manufacturer. The calibrated masses must conform or exceed the ASTM tolerances.

Laboratory balances operate according to the principle \nof compensation of the electromagnetic force applicable to displacements or torques. The combination of their mechanical components and automatic reading systems provides weight measurements at defi  ned levels of accuracy \ndepending on the model. Principle. The mobile parts (weighing plate, support \ncolumn [a], bobbin, position and load indicator [G] -the object in the process of being weighed-) are maintained in equilibrium by a compensation force [F] equal to the weight. The compensation force is generated by an electrical current through a bobbin in the air gap of a cylindrical electromagnet. The force F is calculated with the equation [F = I x L x B] where: I = electrical intensity, L = total length of the wire of the coil and B = magnetic fl  ow intensity in the \nelectromagnet\u2019s air gap.With any change in the load (weight\/mass), the mobile \nmechanical system responds by moving vertically a fraction of distance. Detected by a photosensor [e], an electrical signal is sent to the servo-amplifi  er [f]. This changes the \nfl ow of electrical current passing through the bobbin of the \nmagnet [c] in such a manner that the mobile system returns to the balanced position upon adjusting of the magnetic fl ow in the electromagnet. Consequently, the weight of \nthe mass [G] can be measured indirectly at the start of the electrical current fl  ow, which passes through the circuit \nmeasuring the voltage [V] by means of a precision resistor [R], [V = I x R]. To date, many systems developed use the electronic system for carrying out very exact measurements of mass and weight. The following diagram explains how electronic balances function.

The mobile parts (weighing plate, support \ncolumn [a], bobbin, position and load indicator [G] -the object in the process of being weighed-) are maintained in equilibrium by a compensation force [F] equal to the weight. The compensation force is generated by an electrical current through a bobbin in the air gap of a cylindrical electromagnet. The force F is calculated with the equation [F = I x L x B] where: I = electrical intensity, L = total length of the wire of the coil and B = magnetic fl  ow intensity in the \nelectromagnet\u2019s air gap.With any change in the load (weight\/mass), the mobile \nmechanical system responds by moving vertically a fraction of distance. Detected by a photosensor [e], an electrical signal is sent to the servo-amplifi  er [f]. This changes the \nfl ow of electrical current passing through the bobbin of the \nmagnet [c] in such a manner that the mobile system returns to the balanced position upon adjusting of the magnetic fl ow in the electromagnet. Consequently, the weight of \nthe mass [G] can be measured indirectly at the start of the electrical current fl  ow, which passes through the circuit \nmeasuring the voltage [V] by means of a precision resistor [R], [V = I x R]. To date, many systems developed use the electronic system for carrying out very exact measurements of mass and weight. The following diagram explains how electronic balances function.

These syringes are selected and installed in the dilutor depending on the densities, viscosities, and volumes of fluids to be manipulated. The fluids are transported through flexible tubes, whose diameters, lengths and chemical compatibility are taken into account in the design and manufacturing process for suitability with the selected activity. These tubes are linked using connections manually adjustable. Normally, the syringes are classifi  ed according to \ntheir use (e.g. syringes for reagents, diluents, samples), and the volume these manipulate. The following table shows an example of how they are classifi  ed according to their size \nand managed volumes. Opposite, the components of the dispensing system (syringe \nand dispenser) are shown. INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS\nThe dilutor must be installed on a clean, dry and extremely levelled counter or work surface, far from areas where there \nmay be vapours which can aff  ect its functioning. There must be free space around the equipment for \nfacilitating ventilation and the passage of cables and interconnection lines and cables with the solvent containers, computers or supply systems. The space around the dilutor should be approximately 10 cm. There must be a 115 V, 60 Hz electrical outlet in good \ncondition with a ground pole or alternatively one of 220\u2013240 V, 50\/60 Hz, depending on the manufacturer\u2019s specifi  cations \nand\/or the electrical norms in the country of use.ROUTINE MAINTENANCE \nThe routine maintenance focuses mainly on eliminating contaminants which may accumulate inside the fluid \nmechanisms and\/or lines. The most common routines are the following:\nCleaning of exterior surfaces\nFrequency: Daily\nWarning:  Disconnect the dilutor from the electrical feed \noutlet before beginning the external cleaning process. 1. Clean the exterior surfaces using a clean piece of cloth \ndampened with a mild detergent mixed with water. 2. Lightly rub the surfaces of the dilutor and the \naccessories. 3.

To avoid possible contamination, the electrodes must be rinsed between diff  erent \nsolutions. 1 Verify the type of buff  er solution recommended by the electrode \nmanufacturer.MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n172. Place electrodes in the calibration solution. 2.1 Submerge the electrode in the standardization \nsolution in such a manner that its lower extremity does not touch the bottom of the beaker.

If the test requires that the solution be kept in motion using the magnetic agitator, special care must be taken so that the agitation rod does not hit the electrode as this could break it. Buff  er solution \nis used as a calibration solution, because its pH is known and therefore will still be maintained even if a little contamination occurs.

The mobile parts (weighing plate, support \ncolumn [a], bobbin, position and load indicator [G] -the object in the process of being weighed-) are maintained in equilibrium by a compensation force [F] equal to the weight. The compensation force is generated by an electrical current through a bobbin in the air gap of a cylindrical electromagnet. The force F is calculated with the equation [F = I x L x B] where: I = electrical intensity, L = total length of the wire of the coil and B = magnetic fl  ow intensity in the \nelectromagnet\u2019s air gap.With any change in the load (weight\/mass), the mobile \nmechanical system responds by moving vertically a fraction of distance. Detected by a photosensor [e], an electrical signal is sent to the servo-amplifi  er [f]. This changes the \nfl ow of electrical current passing through the bobbin of the \nmagnet [c] in such a manner that the mobile system returns to the balanced position upon adjusting of the magnetic fl ow in the electromagnet. Consequently, the weight of \nthe mass [G] can be measured indirectly at the start of the electrical current fl  ow, which passes through the circuit \nmeasuring the voltage [V] by means of a precision resistor [R], [V = I x R]. To date, many systems developed use the electronic system for carrying out very exact measurements of mass and weight. The following diagram explains how electronic balances function.

It is controlled by a button generally located on the front part of the balance. It is commonly used for taring the weighing container. 2. Repeatability setting control. During a reading, weighed \nvalues are averaged within a predefi  ned period of time. This function is very useful when weighing operations need to be carried out in unstable conditions, e.g. in the presence of air currents or vibrations. This control defi nes the time period allowed for a result to lie within \npreset limits for it to be considered stable. In addition, it can be adjusted to suit a particular application.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Homogenous liquid mixture (with uniform properties) of two or more substances.

Measurement of the concentration of the hydrogen ion (H+) given in moles per litre (M) in a solution. The pH concept was proposed by S\u00f8rensen and Lindstr\u00f8m-\nLang in 1909 to facilitate expressing very low ion concentrations. It is defi  ned by the following equation:pH = \u2013log [H\n+]      or      [H+] = 10-pH \nIt measures the acidity of a solution.

Extraction is done by a set of needles mounted on the washer\/dryer\u2019s head. The number of needles varies from one to three, according to the washer model used. If it uses only one needle, the washing and \nextraction operation is done with this single needle. If it uses two needles, one is used for supplying the washing solution and the other for extraction. If it uses three needles, the fi  rst is used for supplying the washing \nsolution, the second for extraction and the third for controlling (extracting) any excess volume in the well. Generally, the extraction needle is longer than the supply needle, which enables it to advance (vertically) up to a height ranging between 0.3 and 0.5 mm from the bottom of the well. \u2022\u2022 Advance sub-system. This is composed of a \nmechanism which moves the supply and extraction head horizontally to reach each well in the ELISA plate. When the horizontal movement to the following row occurs, there is a vertical movement towards the well to dispense or extract the washing solution. There are washers which carry out these operations in a simultaneous manner.The sub-systems previously described are shown in Figure \n2. Figure 3 shows the diff  erent types of wells most commonly \nfound in microplates. Each kind of well is suitable for a particular type of test. Washing process\nThe washing of the microplate is one of the stages of the ELISA t echnique. Special solutions are used in the washing \nsteps. Among those most commonly used is phosphate buff er solution or PBS. The phosphate buff  er solution has a \nstability of 2 months if kept at 4 \u00b0C. It is estimated that 1 to 3 litres of solution is required for washing one microplate and that 300 \u00b5l is used in each well per cycle. Washing can \nbe done manually, but it is preferable to use an automated microplate washer for a better throughput and to minimize handling of potentially contaminated substances. Among the washing processes used by microplate washers \nare featured:\n\u2022\u2022 Aspir ation from top to bottom. When the aspiration \nphase is initiated, the needles move vertically and the aspiration is initiated immediately as these enter into the liquid. The process continues until the needles reach their lowest position very close to the bottom of the wells. At this point they are stopped in order to avoid suctioning the air that should fl  ow against the \ninterior lateral walls of the wells. This type of aspiration prevents air currents from drying the bound protein on the surface of the wells.

Well pro\ufb01  les MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n9\u2022\u2022 Simultaneous distribution and aspiration. In certain \ntypes of washer, the washing and aspiration systems operate simultaneously, generating a controlled turbulence inside the well which removes the unbound substances during the incubations. \u2022\u2022 Aspir ation from the base of the wells. In this system, \nthe aspiration of the fluid contained in the wells is performed initially with the aspiration needles in a position very close to the bottom, immediately beginning a suctioning cycle, usually time-controlled. This system may aspirate air if there are diff  erences in \nthe levels of the tanks. Washer calibration\nThe microplate washer is critical for guaranteeing that the ELISA t echnique performs as expected. The alignment to \nbe taken into account for the eff  ective functioning of the \nequipment is presented next:\n\u2022\u2022 Position of the needles (supply and aspiration head). The horizontal and vertical position adjustment with respect to the wells must be verifi  ed carefully. If the \nplate has fl  at bottom wells, the supply needle must be \nchecked to see that it is situated very close to the well\u2019s wall. If the bottom is round or V-shaped, the suction needle should be located in the centre of the well: upon the vertical movement, a needle-base distance is maintained in the well, usually between 0.3 to 0.5 mm. The needles must never be allowed to touch the bottom of the wells to avoid mechanical interferences between the needle point and the well\u2019s base during the aspiration function. \u2022\u2022 Aspir ation time. Appropriately adjust the aspiration \ntime so that a solution fi  lm adhered to the well\u2019s wall \ncan fl  ow towards the bottom. Avoid very long time lapses to prevent the coating on the wells from drying up. Check that the suction system\u2019s needles are clean (free of obstructions). \u2022\u2022 Distributed V olume. Check that the volume distributed \nis as close as possible to the maximum capacity of the well; confi  rm that all the wells are fi  lled uniformly (at \nthe same level). Verify that the distributing needles are clean (free of obstructions). \u2022\u2022 Vacuum. The suctioning system must be calibrated \neffi  ciently. If the vacuum is too strong, the test can \nbe altered. In fact, it could dry out the wells and considerably weaken the enzyme activity in the wells and completely alter the test result. The majority of washers function with a vacuum ranging between 60 and 70% of atmospheric pressure. In some washers, the vacuum is made in an external pump which operates as an accessory of the washer. Its operation is controlled by the washer, which means that the vacuum pump operates only when required. Washing process veri\ufb01  cation \nTo verify that the washing process is done according to \nthe specifications of ELISA t echniques, manufacturers \nof ELISA tests have developed procedures to be carried out regularly. One of the controls\n1 is based on using the \nperoxidase reagent, which is dispensed using a pipette in the plate wells to be read at 405, 450 and 492 nm. At once the wells are washed and a colourless substrate is added (TMB\/H\n2O2\u2013Tetramethylbenzidine\/Hydrogen Peroxide). Whatever conjugate remains will hydrolyze the enzyme and the chromogen will change to blue. After stopping the reaction with acid, the TMB will turn yellow again. The resulting colour intensity is directly related to the washing process effi   ciency. INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS\nFor the microplate washer to operate correctly, the following \nis nec essary: \n1. A clean, dust-free environment.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>An electrical supply source, which complies with the \ncountry\u2019s norms and standards. In the countries of the Americas for example, 110 V and 60 Hertz frequencies are generally used, whereas other regions of the World use 220-240V, 50\/60HZ. Calibration of the microplate reader \nThe calibration of a microplate reader is a specialized process which must be ex ecuted by a technician or trained engineer \nfollowing the instructions provided by each manufacturer. In order to do the calibration, it is necessary to have a set of grey fi  lters mounted on a plate of equal geometric size \nto those used in the analyses. Manufacturers provide these calibration plates for any wavelength the equipment uses. Calibration plates are equipped with at least three pre-\nestablished optic density values within the measurement ranges; low, medium, and high value. In order to perform the calibration, follow this process:1.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>3.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>2. Verify the zero setting.3. Verify the sensitivity adjustment. 4.

The object to be weighed placed \non the weighing plate exercises a pressure distributed randomly over the surface of the plate. By means of a transfer mechanism (levers, supports, guides), the weight\u2019s load is concentrated on a simple force [F] which can be measured. [F = \u222bP\u2202a].

The dilutor has in general, the following components:1. A propulsion system2. A control system3. A dispensing system\nPropulsion system\nThis is generally constituted of positive displacement systems as found in syringes. One or more selectable \nsyringes (with a varying capacity) is\/are used in the dilutor to control the volume to be mixed or diluted. The syringes\u2019 pistons are moved by a mechanism which controls their position. Aspirated volumes or deliveries are calculated by means of the following equation:\nWhere: \n\u2202 V =  fraction of the volume delivered by the syringe when the piston has a displacement   \u2202l.A =  piston area. The total volume aspirated or delivered is the corresponding \nintegral: \n where l\no and l1 correspond to the positions that defi  ne the \npiston\u2019s displacement.Controlling how the pistons move facilitates good control \nover the volumes handled. The displacement system is activated by an electric motor which moves a very precise nuts and screws system and changes the position of the piston. A set of valves controlling the aspiration and supply processes complements the syringes and their displacement systems. The confi  guration of the dilutor depends on the \nmodel and manufacturers. Control system\nModern dilutors have a control system which is automatic or controlled by microprocessors. The latter allow the following \nto be selected and controlled:1.

Protect the rotors\u2019 coating in order to avoid the metal \nbase from deteriorating. Do not use alkaline detergents or cleaning solutions which can remove the protective fi lm. The rotors generally made of aluminium [Al] are \ncovered by a fi  lm of anodized aluminium which protects \ntheir metal structure. 9. Use plastic brushes when cleaning the rotor. Metal \nbrushes scratch the protective coating and generate sources for future corrosion. Corrosion is accelerated in operation conditions and shortens the rotor\u2019s operational life. 10. If there are spills of corrosive substances, wash the rotor \nimmediately. 11. Air dry the rotor once cleaned and washed with water.12. Store vertical tube rotors and almost vertical tube rotors \nwith the larger side facing downwards and without their covers. 13. Store rotors in a dry area. Avoid leaving them in the \ncentrifuge. 14. Store swinging buckets rotors without the compartments\u2019 \ncovers. 15. Lubricate spiral and O-rings, according to the \nmanufacturer\u2019s recommendation. 16. Observe re commendations related to guaranteed times \nand operational life of each type of rotor. 17.

Load or unload rotors inside a biological safety cabinet \nif working with materials classifi  ed as Biosafety level II \nor higher. 20. Never try to open the cover of a centrifuge while it is \nfunctioning and never try to stop the rotor by hand. Tubes \nTube care includes aspects such as fi  lling of the tubes, adequat e temperature selection, centrifugation speed \nlimitations, washing and sterilization. The principle recommendations are the following:1. Wash tubes, adaptors and other accessories by hand \nusing a 1:10 mild detergent solution in water and a soft textured brush (not metallic). Avoid using automatic dishwashers. 2. Avoid using alcohol and acetone since such liquids aff  ect \nthe structure of the tubes. Manufacturers recommend the solvent to be used with each type of centrifugation tube material. 3. Avoid drying tubes in a drying oven. Dry always with a \nstream of hot air.4. Verify if the tubes are reusable or not. If they are \ndisposable, use them only once. 5. For sterilizing, it is necessary to verify the material from \nwhich the tube is made, as not all can stand sterilization by heat. Glass tubes are normally sterilized with vapour at 121 \u00b0C for 30 minutes. 6. Store tubes and bottles in a dark, fresh, dry place, \nfar from chemical vapours or ultraviolet radiation sources. 7. Verify maximum fi  lling levels and the sealing of thin \nwall tubes in order to avoid collapse inside the rotor by the action of the centrifugal force. Comply with manufacturers recommendations. Preventive maintenance\nWarning:  Nev er carry out a technical intervention in a \ncentrifuge if it has not been previously decontaminated. The most important maintenance routines performed on a \ncentrifuge are the following:Frequency: Monthly1. Verify that the centrifuge external components are free \nof dust and stains. Avoid aff  ecting the rotor with spills. Clean the rotor compartment using a mild detergent. 2. Test that the rotors\u2019 connecting and adjustment \nmechanisms are in good condition. Keep the points lubricated as the manufacturer recommends. 3. Verify the locking \/safety mechanism of the centrifuge\u2019s \ncover. This is fundamental in guaranteeing operators\u2019 safety as this mechanism keeps the cover of the centrifuge closed while the rotor is turning. 4.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Stability detector.

The reading is done by using carbon\/quinhydrone \nelectrodes.Description of typical control circuit elements  \n* Diff  erent voltage specifi  cations are applicable in certain regions of the World. INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS\nThe pH meter works using electric current with the following \ncharac teristics. Power:  Single phase Voltage: 110 V or 220-230 V Frequencies; \n50-60Hz depending on the World region. There is also portable pH meters powered with batteries. GENERAL CALIBRATION PROCEDURE\npH analyzers must be calibrated before use to guarantee \nthe qualit y and accuracy of the readings following these \nprocedures:1. One point calibration. This is carried out for normal \nworking conditions and for normal use. It uses one known pH reference solution. 2. Two point calibration. This is done prior to performing \nvery precise measurements. It uses two known pH reference solutions. It is also done if the instrument is used sporadically and its maintenance is not carried out frequently.Description of the process\nFrequency: Daily1. Calibr ate the pH meter using one known pH solution \n(one point calibration). 1.1 Connect the equipment to an electrical outlet with \nsuitable voltage. 1.2 A djust the temperature selector to the \nenvironmental temperature. 1.3 Adjust the meter.1.4 Remove the electrodes from the storage container. The electrodes must always be stored in a suitable solution. Some can be maintained in distilled water, others must be kept in a diff  erent solution \nas their manufacturers recommend\n1. If for some \nreason, the electrode becomes dry, it is necessary to soak it for at least 24 hours before use. 1.5 R inse the electrode with distilled water in an empty \nbeaker. 1.6 Dry the electrode with material able to absorb \nresidual liquid on its surface, without impregnating the electrode. To avoid possible contamination, the electrodes must be rinsed between diff  erent \nsolutions. 1 Verify the type of buff  er solution recommended by the electrode \nmanufacturer.MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n172. Place electrodes in the calibration solution. 2.1 Submerge the electrode in the standardization \nsolution in such a manner that its lower extremity does not touch the bottom of the beaker. This decreases the risk of breaking the electrode. If the test requires that the solution be kept in motion using the magnetic agitator, special care must be taken so that the agitation rod does not hit the electrode as this could break it. Buff  er solution \nis used as a calibration solution, because its pH is known and therefore will still be maintained even if a little contamination occurs. In general, a solution of pH = 7 is used for this purpose\n1.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>There is a calibration error. Recalibrate the pH meter. The calibration of the buff  er value is erroneous.

Verify the polarity of the batteries.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Place the calibration plate on the equipment. 2. Carry out a complete reading with the calibration plate. Verify if there are diff  erences in the readings obtained \nfrom well to well. If this is the case, invert the plate (180\u00b0) and repeat the reading to rule out that diff  erences are \nattributed to the plate itself. In general, it is accepted that the instrument does not need further calibration if the plate results are as expected at two wavelengths. 3. Verify if the reader requires calibration. If so, proceed \nwith the calibration following the routine outlined by the manufacturer, verifying that the reading\u2019s linearity is maintained as rigorously as possible. 4. If the instrument does not have a calibration plate, verify \nit by placing a coloured solution in the wells of a plate and immediately carry out a complete reading. Then invert the plate 180\u00b0 and read the plate again. If both readings display identical, average values in each row, the reader is calibrated. 5. Verify that the reader is calibrated, column by column. Place a clean, empty plate and carry out a reading. If there is no diff  erence between each of the average \nreading of the fi  rst to the last column, it can be assumed \nthat the reader is calibrated. ROUTINE MAINTENANCE \nMaintenance described next focuses exclusively on the micr oplate reader. The maintenance of the microplate \nwasher is described in Chapter 2. Basic maintenance \nFrequency: Daily1. Review that optical sensors of each channel are clean. If dirt is detected, clean the surface of the windows of the light emitters and the sensors with a small brush. 2. Confi  rm that the lighting system is clean. 3. Verify that the reader\u2019s calibration is adequate. When \nthe daily operations begin, let the reader warm up for 30 minutes. Next, do a blank reading and then read a full plate of substrate.

The microplate washer performs the washing of the ELISA plate\u2019s wells during the diff  erent stages of the technique. PHOTOGRAPH OF MICROPLATE WASHER \nPURPOSE OF THE MICROPLATE WASHER \nThe microplate washer has been designed to supply cleaning \nbuff ers required for the ELISA technique in a controlled \nmanner. In the same fashion, the equipment removes from each well, substances in excess from the reaction. Depending on the test performed, the washer can intervene from one to four times, supplying the washing buff  er, agitating and \nremoving the unbound reagents\n1 until the programmed \ntimes and cycles are completed. The washer has of two reservoirs; one for the washing buff  er, the other for the waste \ngenerated during the washing process.OPERATION PRINCIPLES \nThe microplate washer has been designed to perform washing operations in the ELISA t echnique. The equipment \npossesses at least, the following subsystems which vary depending on the manufacturer\u2019s design. \u2022\u2022 Control subsystem. Generally , the washer is controlled \nby microprocessors allowing programming and controlling steps to be performed by the washer such as: number of washing cycles\n2 (1\u20135); expected times; \nsupplying and extracting pressures; plate format (96\u2013384 wells); suction function adjustment according to the type of well\n3 (fl at bottom, V bottom or rounded \nbottom or strips used); volumes distributed or aspirated; the soaking and agitation cycles, etc. \u2022\u2022 Supply subsystem. In general, this comprises a reservoir \nfor the washing solution; one or several pumps; usually a positive displacement type syringe and a dispenser head that supplies the washing solution to the diff  erent \nwells by means of needles. The head usually comes with eight pairs of needles for washing and aspirating simultaneously the wells of the same row (the supply and extraction sub-systems converge on the head). There are models with twelve pairs of needles and others that conduct the washing process simultaneously in all the wells. Some washers off  er the possibility of working \nwith diff  erent types of washing solutions, performing \nthe solution changes according to the program entered by the operator. 1 See a brief explication of the ELISA technique in Chapter 1, Microplate \nReader . 2 The exact number of washing operations required depends on the assay \nused.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>2. Microplate washer (Chapter 2). 3. Liquid dispensing system (multi-channel pipettes may \nbe used). 4. Incubator to incubate the plates. Figure 1 illustrates how this equipment is interrelated. Mechanical phases of the ELISA technique \nUsing the equipment\nWhen an ELISA t est is conducted, it typically follows these \nsteps:  1. A fi  rst washing of the plate may be done using the \nmicroplate washer. 2. Using a liquid dispenser or the multi-channel pipettes, \nwells are fi  lled with the solution prepared to be used in \nthe test. 3. The plate is placed in the incubator where at a controlled \ntemperature, a series of reactions take place. Stages 1, 2 and 3 can be repeated several times depending \non the test, until the reagents added have completed their reactions. Finally, when all the incubation steps have been completed, \nthe plate is transferred to the microplate reader. The reading of the plate is done and a diagnosis can be deduced.Biochemical phases of the ELISA technique1\nThe ELISA technique from a biochemical point of view:1. The plate wells are coated with antibodies or antigens.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Masses conforming to the tolerance defi  ned by the certifi  cation bodies.

Use titanium rotors if working with saline solutions \nfrequently. 8. Protect the rotors\u2019 coating in order to avoid the metal \nbase from deteriorating. Do not use alkaline detergents or cleaning solutions which can remove the protective fi lm. The rotors generally made of aluminium [Al] are \ncovered by a fi  lm of anodized aluminium which protects \ntheir metal structure. 9. Use plastic brushes when cleaning the rotor. Metal \nbrushes scratch the protective coating and generate sources for future corrosion. Corrosion is accelerated in operation conditions and shortens the rotor\u2019s operational life. 10. If there are spills of corrosive substances, wash the rotor \nimmediately. 11. Air dry the rotor once cleaned and washed with water.12. Store vertical tube rotors and almost vertical tube rotors \nwith the larger side facing downwards and without their covers. 13. Store rotors in a dry area. Avoid leaving them in the \ncentrifuge. 14. Store swinging buckets rotors without the compartments\u2019 \ncovers. 15. Lubricate spiral and O-rings, according to the \nmanufacturer\u2019s recommendation. 16. Observe re commendations related to guaranteed times \nand operational life of each type of rotor. 17. Av oid using rotors whose operational lives have \nended. 18. Use a shield if working with radioactive material. 19. Load or unload rotors inside a biological safety cabinet \nif working with materials classifi  ed as Biosafety level II \nor higher. 20. Never try to open the cover of a centrifuge while it is \nfunctioning and never try to stop the rotor by hand. Tubes \nTube care includes aspects such as fi  lling of the tubes, adequat e temperature selection, centrifugation speed \nlimitations, washing and sterilization. The principle recommendations are the following:1. Wash tubes, adaptors and other accessories by hand \nusing a 1:10 mild detergent solution in water and a soft textured brush (not metallic). Avoid using automatic dishwashers. 2. Avoid using alcohol and acetone since such liquids aff  ect \nthe structure of the tubes. Manufacturers recommend the solvent to be used with each type of centrifugation tube material. 3. Avoid drying tubes in a drying oven. Dry always with a \nstream of hot air.4. Verify if the tubes are reusable or not. If they are \ndisposable, use them only once. 5. For sterilizing, it is necessary to verify the material from \nwhich the tube is made, as not all can stand sterilization by heat. Glass tubes are normally sterilized with vapour at 121 \u00b0C for 30 minutes. 6. Store tubes and bottles in a dark, fresh, dry place, \nfar from chemical vapours or ultraviolet radiation sources. 7. Verify maximum fi  lling levels and the sealing of thin \nwall tubes in order to avoid collapse inside the rotor by the action of the centrifugal force. Comply with manufacturers recommendations. Preventive maintenance\nWarning:  Nev er carry out a technical intervention in a \ncentrifuge if it has not been previously decontaminated. The most important maintenance routines performed on a \ncentrifuge are the following:Frequency: Monthly1. Verify that the centrifuge external components are free \nof dust and stains. Avoid aff  ecting the rotor with spills. Clean the rotor compartment using a mild detergent. 2. Test that the rotors\u2019 connecting and adjustment \nmechanisms are in good condition. Keep the points lubricated as the manufacturer recommends. 3. Verify the locking \/safety mechanism of the centrifuge\u2019s \ncover.

The water distiller, also called distillation unit or water still, used in the laboratory, purifi  es running water by means of controlled \nvaporization and cooling processes. Upon applying thermal energy to water in a liquid phase by a warming process, it is changed into vapour. This allows the water molecules to separate from the molecules of other substances mixed or diluted. The water vapour is collected and passed through a condenser, where it is cooled and returned to the liquid phase. Then, the condensed water is collected into a diff  erent storage tank. Distilled water shows pure \ncharacteristics compared to running water; it is practically free of contaminating substances.PURPOSE OF THE WATER DISTILLER\nThe water distiller facilitates obtaining very pure water from potable wat er normally provided by the aqueduct services \nin urban centres. Distilled water is characterized by a lack of solids in suspension. It is used in multiple applications in centres which provide health services, especially in laboratory units, in washing, sterilization and dietetics. The more specialized the procedures are in the laboratory, the greater will be the level of purity required. For example: the preparation of reagents or biological material requires water of the highest quality. Distillation is one of the fundamental processes to achieve this (although it may not be the only one required). Water used in laboratories must be free of pyrogens, with a concentration of total solids no greater than 1 ppm, a pH value between 5.4 and 7.2 and an electrical resistance of at least 3 x 10\n5 ohm\/cm at 25 \u00b0C1. 1 Warming cabinets, sterilizers, and associated equipment , Division 11\u2013 \nEquipment, USACE\/NAVFAC\/ AFCESA, UFGS-11710, July 2003.

This is a balance with a single plate. An unknown mass is placed on the weighing plate. It is weighed by removing known masses from the counterweight side until it reaches a balanced position, using a mechanical system of cams. The fulcrum is generally off  -centre in relation to the length of the load \nbeam and located near the front of the balance. When a mass is placed on the weight plate and the balance\u2019s locking mechanism is released, the movement of the load beam is projected through an optical system to a screen located on the front part of the instrument. Operation veri\ufb01  cation\nThe procedure used for verifying the functioning of a typical \nmechanical balanc e is described below. The described \nprocess is based on the substitution balance.1. Verify that the balance is levelled. The levelling is \nachieved using a ring-shaped adjustment mechanism located on the base of the balance or by adjusting a bubble or knob on a scale located on the front of the balance\u2019s base. 2. Test the  zero mechanism. Place the controls on zero \nand free the balance. If the reading does not stay at zero, adjust the zero mechanism (a grooved screw located in a horizontal position near the fulcrum). To do this, it is necessary to block the balance and slightly adjust the mechanism. The process is to be continued until the zero adjusts correctly on the reading scale.3. Verify and adjust the sensitivity. This is always readjusted \nwhenever some internal adjustment is done. It is performed with a known standard according to the following steps:\na) Lock the balance.b) Place a standard weight (equivalent to the optical \nscale range) on the plate. c) Position the micro setting to one (1). d) Release the balance. e) Adjust to the zero position.f) Position the micro setting to zero (0). The balance \nshould indicate 100. If the scale displays less or more than 100, the sensitivity control must be adjusted. This requires locking the balance, opening the upper cover and turning the sensitivity screw: If the scale registers more than 100; turn the screw in a clockwise position. If the scale registers less than 100, it is necessary to unwind the screw anticlockwise. Repeat the process until the balance is adjusted (adjusting the zero and the sensitivity).Type of mass Capacity\nSimple pieces \n 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 g \n100, 200 and 500 g \nFractional pieces \n 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 mg \n100, 200 and 500 mg \nMass\nPlate\nFlexible\nConnections\nSupport ColumnFGFigure 10.

A process through which a fl  uid in liquid phase is heated until converted into vapour and then cooled and condensed back into liquid phase. The \ndistillation process is used for separating mixed substances, taking advantage of their diff  erence in volatility. To obtain ver y pure substances, consecutive distillation \ncycles are performed with the aim of progressively eliminating other substances present in the mix. Hardness (of water). A chemical characteristic of water determined by the carbonate, bicarbonate, chlorine, sulphate and occasionally calcium nitra te and \nmagnesium content. The resulting resistance is undesirable in some processes. There are two types of resistors in water. \u2022 Temporary hardness. This is determined by the magnesium and calcium carbonate and bicarbonate content. It may be eliminated by boiling the water a nd \nsubsequently fi  ltering out the precipitate. It is also known as carbonate resistance. \u2022 Permanent hardness. This is determined by all the calcium and magnesium salts, except the carbonates and bicarbonates. It cannot be eliminated by the \nboiling of water and it is also known as non-bicarbonate resistance.

The \ncentrifuge is designed to use the centrifugal force generated in rotational movements to separate the constitutive elements of a mixture. There is a wide range of centrifuges capable of serving specifi  c industry and research needs. This \nchapter focuses on standing centrifuges normally used in public health and clinical laboratories. PHOTOGRAPH OF CENTRIFUGEPURPOSE OF THE CENTRIFUGE\nThe centrifuge uses centrifugal force (the force generated \nwhen an objec t rotates around a single point), for separating \nsolids suspended in a liquid by sedimentation, or liquids of diverse density. The rotational movements allow forces much greater than gravity to be generated in controlled periods of time. In the laboratory, centrifuges are generally used in processes such as the separation of solid components from biological liquids through sedimentation and in particular of blood components: red cells, white cells, platelets among others and for conducting multiple tests and treatments.There are several kinds of centrifuges. The most widely used in public health, surveillance and clinical laboratories are the table-top centrifuge, the ultracentrifuge, the haeamatocrit centrifuge and the standing centrifuge. OPERATION PRINCIPLES \nCentrifuges represent a practical application of Newton\u2019s law of motion. When a body of mass [m] turns around \na central point [O], it is subjected to a centripetal  force \n[N] directed towards the rotation axis with a magnitude N = m\u03c9\n2R, where [m] is the mass of the body, [R] is the radius \nand \u03c9 is the angular speed. Centrifuges possess a rotating axis on which is mounted a rotor with sample receiving compartments. Tangential speed is defi  ned by the following \nequation: VT=\u03c9R. Photo courtesy of Beckman CoulterCHAPTER 7  CENTRIFUGE\n46When the system spins at a speed of \u03c9 radians per second, \nthe samples are subjected to the centrifugal force Fp of the \nsame magnitude as N, but in an opposite direction. The \nfi gure shown below1 features a diagram of the concept, \nof its actual application and of the obtained result. This Fp force acts on particles in the substance centrifuged, \ncausing them to separate as a result of diff  erences in density. Denser particles will settle at the bottom of the tube in shorter periods of time, while lighter ones require longer periods of time, settling onto those of greater density. The relationship between the centrifugal acceleration [\u03c9\n2r ] to a \ngiven radius [r] and the force of gravity [g] is known as the relative centrifugal fi  eld or [RCF]\n2. RCF =r\u03c92\ng\nThe RCF is the tool which allows rotors of different \nspecifi  cations to be compared when equivalent centrifugal \neff ects are required. COMPONENTS OF THE CENTRIFUGE \nThe most important components of a centrifuge are the \nfollowing3:\nThe electric\/electronic control which generally has the following elements:1. On and off control, operation time control (timer), \nrotation speed control (in some centrifuges), temperature control (in refrigerated centrifuges), vibration control (safety mechanism) and brake system.2. Refrigeration system (in refrigerated centrifuges). 3. Vacuum system (in ultracentrifuges, not shown in the \nfi gure). 4.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>7. Avoid using the water bath with the substances \nindicated below:\na) Bleach.b) Liquids with high chlorine content. c) Weak saline solutions such as sodium chloride, \ncalcium chloride or chromium compounds. d) Strong concentrations of any acid.e) Strong concentrations of any salt.f ) Weak concentrations of hydrochloric, hydrobromic, \nhydroiodic, sulphuric or chromic acids. g) Deionised water, as it causes corrosion and \nperforation in the stainless steel. Maintenance\nWarning : Bef ore carrying out any maintenance activity, \ndisconnect the equipment from the electrical feed outlet. Water baths are equipment whose maintenance is simple. The recommended routines mainly focus on the cleaning of external components. The most common routines are featured next. Cleaning\nFrequency: Monthly1. T urn off   and disconnect the equipment. Wait until it \ncools to avoid the risk of burns and accidents. 2. Remove the fl  uid used for heating. If it is water, it can \nbe poured through a siphon. If it is oil; collect into a container with an adequate capacity. 3. Remove the thermal diff  usion grid located at the bottom \nof the tank. 4. Disassemble the circulator and clean to remove scale \nand potential algae present. 5.<\/DOCUMENT>\n2. Can different measuring units be selected?

In general the diff  using tray is made of stainless steel. Electrostatic painting. A painting process that uses the particle-attracting property of electrostatic charges. A potential diff  erence of 80-150kV is applied to a \ngrid of wires through which the paint is sprayed to charge each particle. The metal objects to be sprayed are connected to the opposite terminal of the high-voltage \ncircuit, so that they attract the particles of paint. The piece covered with paint particles is then placed in an electrical ov en to melt the particles, making them adhere \nstrongly to the piece. Fuse. A safety device which protects the electrical circuits from excessive current. Fuses are made of materials whose dimensions an d properties equip them to \nwork well within some predefi  ned conditions. If for some reason the design parameters are exceeded, the material burns out and interrupts the passage of the \nelectrical current. Immersion resistor . An electrical resistor (see defi  nition below) inside of a sealed tube. These are generally used for heating fl  uids as water o r oil. Resistance. Opposition that a material or electrical circuit imposes to the fl  ow of electric current. It is the property of a circuit that  transforms electrical energy \ninto heat as it opposes the fl  ow of current. The resistance [R], of a body of uniform section such as a wire, is directly propo rtional to the length [l] and inversely \nproportional to the sectional area [a]. The resistance is calculated by the following equation:\nR=k\u00d7l\na\nWhere: \nk  = constant that depends on the units employed \nl  = Length of the conductor a  = sectional area of the conductor \nThe ohm (\u03a9) is the common unit of electrical resistance; one ohm is equal to one volt per ampere.MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n35Chapter 6\nBiological Safety Cabinet\nThis equipment is designed for controlling aerosols and \nmicroparticles associated with managing potentially toxic or infectious biological material in laboratories in activities such as agitation, centrifugation, pipetting, and opening of pressurized containers.

ROUTINE MAINTENANCE\nThe routine maintenance required by a centrifuge depends on multiple fac tors such as the incorporated technology, \nusage intensity, training of users, quality of the electrical feed and environmental conditions. The following are general recommendations regarding adequate use and most common maintenance for guaranteeing correct operation. The routines or specialized repairs will depend on manufacturers\u2019 recommendations for each brand and model. Always disinfect the rotor bowl, centrifuge head, buckets and trunnion rings as applicable before any servicing of centrifuges used to prepare clinical or infectious samples. Priority recommendation. Verify that only qualifi  ed personnel \ntrained and familiar with the use, care, risks and handling of the centrifuge operates it. It is the laboratory directors\u2019 responsibility to supervise and take necessary precautions so that personnel operating centrifuges understand the implications of working with such equipment. APPROPRIATE MANAGEMENT AND STORAGE RECOMMEND ATIONS\n1\nRotors\n1. Register the date of purchase of each one of the rotors, \nincluding inf ormation related to the serial and model \nnumber. 2. Read and understand the rotor manuals, equipment \nand tubes before use. Comply with indications for use and care specifi  ed by the manufacturer. 3. Use rotors only in centrifuges for which these have \nbeen manufactured. Do not interchange rotors without verifying the compatibility with the centrifuge. 4. Register operation parameters for each rotor in a log \nbook in order to determine its remaining operational life and to acquire its replacements when needed. 5. Use the recommendations regarding maximum speed \nand sample density from the manufacturer. Each rotor is designed for supporting a maximum level of eff  ort; \nthese specifi  cations must be followed rigorously. 1 http:\/\/www.sunysb.edu\/facilities\/ehs\/lab\/cs.shtmlk=lnrmaxrmin ()\n\u03c92\u00d71013\n3600MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n49\n6.

Its purpose is to give a better \nunderstanding of the technical requirements regarding installation, use and maintenance of various types of equipment which play an important role in performing diagnostic testing. The manual also aims to provide support to personnel responsible for technical management, implementation of quality management and maintenance. Due to the diversity of origins, brands and models, this manual off  ers general recommendations. Equipment-specifi  c details \nare explained in depth in the maintenance and installation user manuals from manufacturers. These should be requested and ordered through the procurement processes of the individual agencies and professionals responsible for the acquisition of technology, or directly from the manufacturer.

Substitution Balance (Unequal-lever arm or two-\nknife balance). This is a balance with a single plate. An unknown mass is placed on the weighing plate. It is weighed by removing known masses from the counterweight side until it reaches a balanced position, using a mechanical system of cams. The fulcrum is generally off  -centre in relation to the length of the load \nbeam and located near the front of the balance. When a mass is placed on the weight plate and the balance\u2019s locking mechanism is released, the movement of the load beam is projected through an optical system to a screen located on the front part of the instrument. Operation veri\ufb01  cation\nThe procedure used for verifying the functioning of a typical \nmechanical balanc e is described below. The described \nprocess is based on the substitution balance.1. Verify that the balance is levelled. The levelling is \nachieved using a ring-shaped adjustment mechanism located on the base of the balance or by adjusting a bubble or knob on a scale located on the front of the balance\u2019s base. 2. Test the  zero mechanism. Place the controls on zero \nand free the balance. If the reading does not stay at zero, adjust the zero mechanism (a grooved screw located in a horizontal position near the fulcrum). To do this, it is necessary to block the balance and slightly adjust the mechanism. The process is to be continued until the zero adjusts correctly on the reading scale.3. Verify and adjust the sensitivity. This is always readjusted \nwhenever some internal adjustment is done. It is performed with a known standard according to the following steps:\na) Lock the balance.b) Place a standard weight (equivalent to the optical \nscale range) on the plate. c) Position the micro setting to one (1). d) Release the balance. e) Adjust to the zero position.f) Position the micro setting to zero (0). The balance \nshould indicate 100. If the scale displays less or more than 100, the sensitivity control must be adjusted. This requires locking the balance, opening the upper cover and turning the sensitivity screw: If the scale registers more than 100; turn the screw in a clockwise position. If the scale registers less than 100, it is necessary to unwind the screw anticlockwise. Repeat the process until the balance is adjusted (adjusting the zero and the sensitivity).Type of mass Capacity\nSimple pieces \n 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 g \n100, 200 and 500 g \nFractional pieces \n 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 mg \n100, 200 and 500 mg \nMass\nPlate\nFlexible\nConnections\nSupport ColumnFGFigure 10.

An electrical safety analyzer or an instrument for \nmeasuring escaping current. 3.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Substitution balance CHAPTER 4  BALANCES\n244. Verify the plate\u2019s brake. It is mounted on a threaded \naxis which touches the plate in order to prevent it from oscillating when the balance is locked.

Maintenance of the mechanical balance\nThe maintenance of mechanical balances is limited to the following routines:\nFrequency: Daily1. Verify the level.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>7. Use titanium rotors if working with saline solutions \nfrequently. 8. Protect the rotors\u2019 coating in order to avoid the metal \nbase from deteriorating. Do not use alkaline detergents or cleaning solutions which can remove the protective fi lm. The rotors generally made of aluminium [Al] are \ncovered by a fi  lm of anodized aluminium which protects \ntheir metal structure. 9. Use plastic brushes when cleaning the rotor. Metal \nbrushes scratch the protective coating and generate sources for future corrosion. Corrosion is accelerated in operation conditions and shortens the rotor\u2019s operational life. 10. If there are spills of corrosive substances, wash the rotor \nimmediately. 11. Air dry the rotor once cleaned and washed with water.12. Store vertical tube rotors and almost vertical tube rotors \nwith the larger side facing downwards and without their covers. 13. Store rotors in a dry area. Avoid leaving them in the \ncentrifuge. 14. Store swinging buckets rotors without the compartments\u2019 \ncovers. 15. Lubricate spiral and O-rings, according to the \nmanufacturer\u2019s recommendation. 16. Observe re commendations related to guaranteed times \nand operational life of each type of rotor. 17. Av oid using rotors whose operational lives have \nended. 18. Use a shield if working with radioactive material. 19. Load or unload rotors inside a biological safety cabinet \nif working with materials classifi  ed as Biosafety level II \nor higher. 20. Never try to open the cover of a centrifuge while it is \nfunctioning and never try to stop the rotor by hand. Tubes \nTube care includes aspects such as fi  lling of the tubes, adequat e temperature selection, centrifugation speed \nlimitations, washing and sterilization. The principle recommendations are the following:1. Wash tubes, adaptors and other accessories by hand \nusing a 1:10 mild detergent solution in water and a soft textured brush (not metallic). Avoid using automatic dishwashers. 2. Avoid using alcohol and acetone since such liquids aff  ect \nthe structure of the tubes. Manufacturers recommend the solvent to be used with each type of centrifugation tube material. 3. Avoid drying tubes in a drying oven. Dry always with a \nstream of hot air.4. Verify if the tubes are reusable or not. If they are \ndisposable, use them only once. 5. For sterilizing, it is necessary to verify the material from \nwhich the tube is made, as not all can stand sterilization by heat. Glass tubes are normally sterilized with vapour at 121 \u00b0C for 30 minutes. 6. Store tubes and bottles in a dark, fresh, dry place, \nfar from chemical vapours or ultraviolet radiation sources. 7. Verify maximum fi  lling levels and the sealing of thin \nwall tubes in order to avoid collapse inside the rotor by the action of the centrifugal force. Comply with manufacturers recommendations. Preventive maintenance\nWarning:  Nev er carry out a technical intervention in a \ncentrifuge if it has not been previously decontaminated. The most important maintenance routines performed on a \ncentrifuge are the following:Frequency: Monthly1. Verify that the centrifuge external components are free \nof dust and stains. Avoid aff  ecting the rotor with spills. Clean the rotor compartment using a mild detergent. 2. Test that the rotors\u2019 connecting and adjustment \nmechanisms are in good condition. Keep the points lubricated as the manufacturer recommends. 3. Verify the locking \/safety mechanism of the centrifuge\u2019s \ncover. This is fundamental in guaranteeing operators\u2019 safety as this mechanism keeps the cover of the centrifuge closed while the rotor is turning. 4.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>It is expressed as the \nratio between the arc formed by the angle with its vertex in the centre of the circle, and the radius of that circle.

The dilutor has in general, the following components:1. A propulsion system2. A control system3. A dispensing system\nPropulsion system\nThis is generally constituted of positive displacement systems as found in syringes. One or more selectable \nsyringes (with a varying capacity) is\/are used in the dilutor to control the volume to be mixed or diluted. The syringes\u2019 pistons are moved by a mechanism which controls their position. Aspirated volumes or deliveries are calculated by means of the following equation:\nWhere: \n\u2202 V =  fraction of the volume delivered by the syringe when the piston has a displacement   \u2202l.A =  piston area. The total volume aspirated or delivered is the corresponding \nintegral: \n where l\no and l1 correspond to the positions that defi  ne the \npiston\u2019s displacement.Controlling how the pistons move facilitates good control \nover the volumes handled. The displacement system is activated by an electric motor which moves a very precise nuts and screws system and changes the position of the piston. A set of valves controlling the aspiration and supply processes complements the syringes and their displacement systems. The confi  guration of the dilutor depends on the \nmodel and manufacturers. Control system\nModern dilutors have a control system which is automatic or controlled by microprocessors. The latter allow the following \nto be selected and controlled:1. Mixing processes and\/or dissolution of substances \n(programmable)\n2. Predefi  ned volume supply\n3. Supply or suction velocities4. Number of required cycles5. Size or volume of selected syringes6.

Extraction is done by a set of needles mounted on the washer\/dryer\u2019s head. The number of needles varies from one to three, according to the washer model used. If it uses only one needle, the washing and \nextraction operation is done with this single needle. If it uses two needles, one is used for supplying the washing solution and the other for extraction. If it uses three needles, the fi  rst is used for supplying the washing \nsolution, the second for extraction and the third for controlling (extracting) any excess volume in the well. Generally, the extraction needle is longer than the supply needle, which enables it to advance (vertically) up to a height ranging between 0.3 and 0.5 mm from the bottom of the well. \u2022\u2022 Advance sub-system. This is composed of a \nmechanism which moves the supply and extraction head horizontally to reach each well in the ELISA plate. When the horizontal movement to the following row occurs, there is a vertical movement towards the well to dispense or extract the washing solution. There are washers which carry out these operations in a simultaneous manner.The sub-systems previously described are shown in Figure \n2. Figure 3 shows the diff  erent types of wells most commonly \nfound in microplates. Each kind of well is suitable for a particular type of test. Washing process\nThe washing of the microplate is one of the stages of the ELISA t echnique. Special solutions are used in the washing \nsteps. Among those most commonly used is phosphate buff er solution or PBS. The phosphate buff  er solution has a \nstability of 2 months if kept at 4 \u00b0C. It is estimated that 1 to 3 litres of solution is required for washing one microplate and that 300 \u00b5l is used in each well per cycle. Washing can \nbe done manually, but it is preferable to use an automated microplate washer for a better throughput and to minimize handling of potentially contaminated substances. Among the washing processes used by microplate washers \nare featured:\n\u2022\u2022 Aspir ation from top to bottom. When the aspiration \nphase is initiated, the needles move vertically and the aspiration is initiated immediately as these enter into the liquid. The process continues until the needles reach their lowest position very close to the bottom of the wells. At this point they are stopped in order to avoid suctioning the air that should fl  ow against the \ninterior lateral walls of the wells. This type of aspiration prevents air currents from drying the bound protein on the surface of the wells.

In certain \ntypes of washer, the washing and aspiration systems operate simultaneously, generating a controlled turbulence inside the well which removes the unbound substances during the incubations. \u2022\u2022 Aspir ation from the base of the wells. In this system, \nthe aspiration of the fluid contained in the wells is performed initially with the aspiration needles in a position very close to the bottom, immediately beginning a suctioning cycle, usually time-controlled. This system may aspirate air if there are diff  erences in \nthe levels of the tanks. Washer calibration\nThe microplate washer is critical for guaranteeing that the ELISA t echnique performs as expected. The alignment to \nbe taken into account for the eff  ective functioning of the \nequipment is presented next:\n\u2022\u2022 Position of the needles (supply and aspiration head). The horizontal and vertical position adjustment with respect to the wells must be verifi  ed carefully. If the \nplate has fl  at bottom wells, the supply needle must be \nchecked to see that it is situated very close to the well\u2019s wall. If the bottom is round or V-shaped, the suction needle should be located in the centre of the well: upon the vertical movement, a needle-base distance is maintained in the well, usually between 0.3 to 0.5 mm. The needles must never be allowed to touch the bottom of the wells to avoid mechanical interferences between the needle point and the well\u2019s base during the aspiration function. \u2022\u2022 Aspir ation time. Appropriately adjust the aspiration \ntime so that a solution fi  lm adhered to the well\u2019s wall \ncan fl  ow towards the bottom. Avoid very long time lapses to prevent the coating on the wells from drying up. Check that the suction system\u2019s needles are clean (free of obstructions). \u2022\u2022 Distributed V olume. Check that the volume distributed \nis as close as possible to the maximum capacity of the well; confi  rm that all the wells are fi  lled uniformly (at \nthe same level). Verify that the distributing needles are clean (free of obstructions). \u2022\u2022 Vacuum. The suctioning system must be calibrated \neffi  ciently. If the vacuum is too strong, the test can \nbe altered. In fact, it could dry out the wells and considerably weaken the enzyme activity in the wells and completely alter the test result. The majority of washers function with a vacuum ranging between 60 and 70% of atmospheric pressure. In some washers, the vacuum is made in an external pump which operates as an accessory of the washer. Its operation is controlled by the washer, which means that the vacuum pump operates only when required. Washing process veri\ufb01  cation \nTo verify that the washing process is done according to \nthe specifications of ELISA t echniques, manufacturers \nof ELISA tests have developed procedures to be carried out regularly. One of the controls\n1 is based on using the \nperoxidase reagent, which is dispensed using a pipette in the plate wells to be read at 405, 450 and 492 nm. At once the wells are washed and a colourless substrate is added (TMB\/H\n2O2\u2013Tetramethylbenzidine\/Hydrogen Peroxide). Whatever conjugate remains will hydrolyze the enzyme and the chromogen will change to blue. After stopping the reaction with acid, the TMB will turn yellow again. The resulting colour intensity is directly related to the washing process effi   ciency. INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS\nFor the microplate washer to operate correctly, the following \nis nec essary: \n1.

The water distiller, also called distillation unit or water still, used in the laboratory, purifi  es running water by means of controlled \nvaporization and cooling processes. Upon applying thermal energy to water in a liquid phase by a warming process, it is changed into vapour. This allows the water molecules to separate from the molecules of other substances mixed or diluted. The water vapour is collected and passed through a condenser, where it is cooled and returned to the liquid phase. Then, the condensed water is collected into a diff  erent storage tank. Distilled water shows pure \ncharacteristics compared to running water; it is practically free of contaminating substances.PURPOSE OF THE WATER DISTILLER\nThe water distiller facilitates obtaining very pure water from potable wat er normally provided by the aqueduct services \nin urban centres. Distilled water is characterized by a lack of solids in suspension. It is used in multiple applications in centres which provide health services, especially in laboratory units, in washing, sterilization and dietetics. The more specialized the procedures are in the laboratory, the greater will be the level of purity required. For example: the preparation of reagents or biological material requires water of the highest quality. Distillation is one of the fundamental processes to achieve this (although it may not be the only one required). Water used in laboratories must be free of pyrogens, with a concentration of total solids no greater than 1 ppm, a pH value between 5.4 and 7.2 and an electrical resistance of at least 3 x 10\n5 ohm\/cm at 25 \u00b0C1. 1 Warming cabinets, sterilizers, and associated equipment , Division 11\u2013 \nEquipment, USACE\/NAVFAC\/ AFCESA, UFGS-11710, July 2003.

When atmospheric conditions are suitable, these cool and condense the water which returns to the surface of the Earth in the form of rain. Functioning of the water distiller\nThe water distiller reproduces the natural phenomenon described abo ve. The configuration and design vary \ndepending on the volume of water required. The following is a general explanation of the components of a distiller and a description of how these function. 1. Vapour generator. Also known as the boiling tank, \nthis component is the container where the water to be distilled is stored. In general, it has a hydraulic connection which allows the water evaporated and distilled to be replenished. It is generally made of glass in small distillers or of stainless steel with copper, tin or titanium coverings in large capacity machines. It can have level, fl  ow and water quality feed controls, which \nprotect the distiller in case some irregularity in the water supply occurs. As a source of energy, it uses the water vapour coming from a boiler or vapour generator, or the thermal energy from electrical immersion resistors through direct conduction. These cause the water temperature to rise until, in normal conditions (atmospheric pressure equal to an atmosphere and gravity acceleration equal to 9.80665 m\/s\n2) water in the \nliquid phase is transformed into vapour at 100 \u00b0C. 2.<\/DOCUMENT>\nWhat does \"2\" symbolize in various cultures?

Protect the rotors\u2019 coating in order to avoid the metal \nbase from deteriorating. Do not use alkaline detergents or cleaning solutions which can remove the protective fi lm. The rotors generally made of aluminium [Al] are \ncovered by a fi  lm of anodized aluminium which protects \ntheir metal structure. 9. Use plastic brushes when cleaning the rotor. Metal \nbrushes scratch the protective coating and generate sources for future corrosion. Corrosion is accelerated in operation conditions and shortens the rotor\u2019s operational life. 10. If there are spills of corrosive substances, wash the rotor \nimmediately. 11. Air dry the rotor once cleaned and washed with water.12. Store vertical tube rotors and almost vertical tube rotors \nwith the larger side facing downwards and without their covers. 13. Store rotors in a dry area. Avoid leaving them in the \ncentrifuge. 14. Store swinging buckets rotors without the compartments\u2019 \ncovers. 15. Lubricate spiral and O-rings, according to the \nmanufacturer\u2019s recommendation. 16. Observe re commendations related to guaranteed times \nand operational life of each type of rotor. 17. Av oid using rotors whose operational lives have \nended. 18. Use a shield if working with radioactive material. 19. Load or unload rotors inside a biological safety cabinet \nif working with materials classifi  ed as Biosafety level II \nor higher. 20. Never try to open the cover of a centrifuge while it is \nfunctioning and never try to stop the rotor by hand. Tubes \nTube care includes aspects such as fi  lling of the tubes, adequat e temperature selection, centrifugation speed \nlimitations, washing and sterilization. The principle recommendations are the following:1. Wash tubes, adaptors and other accessories by hand \nusing a 1:10 mild detergent solution in water and a soft textured brush (not metallic). Avoid using automatic dishwashers. 2. Avoid using alcohol and acetone since such liquids aff  ect \nthe structure of the tubes. Manufacturers recommend the solvent to be used with each type of centrifugation tube material. 3. Avoid drying tubes in a drying oven. Dry always with a \nstream of hot air.4. Verify if the tubes are reusable or not. If they are \ndisposable, use them only once. 5. For sterilizing, it is necessary to verify the material from \nwhich the tube is made, as not all can stand sterilization by heat. Glass tubes are normally sterilized with vapour at 121 \u00b0C for 30 minutes. 6. Store tubes and bottles in a dark, fresh, dry place, \nfar from chemical vapours or ultraviolet radiation sources. 7. Verify maximum fi  lling levels and the sealing of thin \nwall tubes in order to avoid collapse inside the rotor by the action of the centrifugal force. Comply with manufacturers recommendations. Preventive maintenance\nWarning:  Nev er carry out a technical intervention in a \ncentrifuge if it has not been previously decontaminated. The most important maintenance routines performed on a \ncentrifuge are the following:Frequency: Monthly1. Verify that the centrifuge external components are free \nof dust and stains. Avoid aff  ecting the rotor with spills. Clean the rotor compartment using a mild detergent. 2. Test that the rotors\u2019 connecting and adjustment \nmechanisms are in good condition.

A process through which a fl  uid in liquid phase is heated until converted into vapour and then cooled and condensed back into liquid phase. The \ndistillation process is used for separating mixed substances, taking advantage of their diff  erence in volatility. To obtain ver y pure substances, consecutive distillation \ncycles are performed with the aim of progressively eliminating other substances present in the mix. Hardness (of water). A chemical characteristic of water determined by the carbonate, bicarbonate, chlorine, sulphate and occasionally calcium nitra te and \nmagnesium content. The resulting resistance is undesirable in some processes. There are two types of resistors in water. \u2022 Temporary hardness. This is determined by the magnesium and calcium carbonate and bicarbonate content. It may be eliminated by boiling the water a nd \nsubsequently fi  ltering out the precipitate. It is also known as carbonate resistance. \u2022 Permanent hardness. This is determined by all the calcium and magnesium salts, except the carbonates and bicarbonates. It cannot be eliminated by the \nboiling of water and it is also known as non-bicarbonate resistance.

Always use a clean, pre-weighed container for weighing \n(glass container or weighing paper if possible). Note that plastic can become electromagnetically charged and is not recommended for weighing powdered or granulated chemicals. 5.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>A perfectly levelled table\/counter. A platform of high \ninertia, isolated from the structures located in its vicinity is ideal to reduce the eff  ect of vibrations from certain \nequipment such as centrifuges and refrigerators. There must be a large enough area for installing the balance and any auxiliary equipment needed during the weighing processes. Likewise, the space required for cables such as the interconnection, electrical current cables and the information system connection to the printer must be anticipated. 3. Avoid installing equipment which produces elevated \nmagnetic fi  elds or vibrations like centrifuges, electrical \nmotors, compressors and generators in its vicinity. 4. Avoid locating it directly under the air-conditioning \nsystem (air currents) and sunlight. 5. An electrical outlet which complies with the current \nelectrical standards in the country or the laboratory. It must be in good condition and equipped with a ground pole and switches.Electronic balance operation\nThe operation of a modern electronic balance is clearly detailed in its operat or\u2019s manual from the manufacturer. In \ngeneral, it must conform to the following procedure:1. Allow the balance to equilibrate with the environment \nwhere it is installed. 2. Allow the balance to warm-up before initiating activities. Normally it is suffi   cient to have it connected to the \nelectrical feed system. Some manufacturers suggest at least 20 minutes from the moment it is energized until use. Analytical balances Class 1 require at least 2 hours for warming before initiating use. Verify that the balance is calibrated. Electronic \nbalances generally have a factory-made calibration stored in memory which can be used if it does not have calibration masses. If calibration is required, use calibrated masses as indicated by the manufacturer. The calibrated masses must conform or exceed the ASTM tolerances. For general information, the following table shows the accepted tolerance for the ASTM Class 1\n1 \nmasses. 3.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>2. A measuring device known as \u201cload cell\u201d produces an \nexit signal corresponding to the load\u2019s force in the form of changes in the voltage or frequency. 3. A digital analogous electronic circuit shows the fi  nal \nresult of the weight digitally. Laboratory balances operate according to the principle \nof compensation of the electromagnetic force applicable to displacements or torques. The combination of their mechanical components and automatic reading systems provides weight measurements at defi  ned levels of accuracy \ndepending on the model. Principle. The mobile parts (weighing plate, support \ncolumn [a], bobbin, position and load indicator [G] -the object in the process of being weighed-) are maintained in equilibrium by a compensation force [F] equal to the weight. The compensation force is generated by an electrical current through a bobbin in the air gap of a cylindrical electromagnet. The force F is calculated with the equation [F = I x L x B] where: I = electrical intensity, L = total length of the wire of the coil and B = magnetic fl  ow intensity in the \nelectromagnet\u2019s air gap.With any change in the load (weight\/mass), the mobile \nmechanical system responds by moving vertically a fraction of distance. Detected by a photosensor [e], an electrical signal is sent to the servo-amplifi  er [f]. This changes the \nfl ow of electrical current passing through the bobbin of the \nmagnet [c] in such a manner that the mobile system returns to the balanced position upon adjusting of the magnetic fl ow in the electromagnet. Consequently, the weight of \nthe mass [G] can be measured indirectly at the start of the electrical current fl  ow, which passes through the circuit \nmeasuring the voltage [V] by means of a precision resistor [R], [V = I x R]. To date, many systems developed use the electronic system for carrying out very exact measurements of mass and weight. The following diagram explains how electronic balances function.

The signal process comprises the following functions:1. Tare setting. This setting is used to adjust the reading \nvalue at zero with any load within the balance\u2019s capacity range. It is controlled by a button generally located on the front part of the balance. It is commonly used for taring the weighing container. 2. Repeatability setting control. During a reading, weighed \nvalues are averaged within a predefi  ned period of time. This function is very useful when weighing operations need to be carried out in unstable conditions, e.g. in the presence of air currents or vibrations. This control defi nes the time period allowed for a result to lie within \npreset limits for it to be considered stable. In addition, it can be adjusted to suit a particular application.<\/DOCUMENT>\n3.

The \ncentrifuge is designed to use the centrifugal force generated in rotational movements to separate the constitutive elements of a mixture. There is a wide range of centrifuges capable of serving specifi  c industry and research needs. This \nchapter focuses on standing centrifuges normally used in public health and clinical laboratories. PHOTOGRAPH OF CENTRIFUGEPURPOSE OF THE CENTRIFUGE\nThe centrifuge uses centrifugal force (the force generated \nwhen an objec t rotates around a single point), for separating \nsolids suspended in a liquid by sedimentation, or liquids of diverse density. The rotational movements allow forces much greater than gravity to be generated in controlled periods of time. In the laboratory, centrifuges are generally used in processes such as the separation of solid components from biological liquids through sedimentation and in particular of blood components: red cells, white cells, platelets among others and for conducting multiple tests and treatments.There are several kinds of centrifuges. The most widely used in public health, surveillance and clinical laboratories are the table-top centrifuge, the ultracentrifuge, the haeamatocrit centrifuge and the standing centrifuge. OPERATION PRINCIPLES \nCentrifuges represent a practical application of Newton\u2019s law of motion. When a body of mass [m] turns around \na central point [O], it is subjected to a centripetal  force \n[N] directed towards the rotation axis with a magnitude N = m\u03c9\n2R, where [m] is the mass of the body, [R] is the radius \nand \u03c9 is the angular speed. Centrifuges possess a rotating axis on which is mounted a rotor with sample receiving compartments. Tangential speed is defi  ned by the following \nequation: VT=\u03c9R. Photo courtesy of Beckman CoulterCHAPTER 7  CENTRIFUGE\n46When the system spins at a speed of \u03c9 radians per second, \nthe samples are subjected to the centrifugal force Fp of the \nsame magnitude as N, but in an opposite direction. The \nfi gure shown below1 features a diagram of the concept, \nof its actual application and of the obtained result. This Fp force acts on particles in the substance centrifuged, \ncausing them to separate as a result of diff  erences in density. Denser particles will settle at the bottom of the tube in shorter periods of time, while lighter ones require longer periods of time, settling onto those of greater density. The relationship between the centrifugal acceleration [\u03c9\n2r ] to a \ngiven radius [r] and the force of gravity [g] is known as the relative centrifugal fi  eld or [RCF]\n2. RCF =r\u03c92\ng\nThe RCF is the tool which allows rotors of different \nspecifi  cations to be compared when equivalent centrifugal \neff ects are required. COMPONENTS OF THE CENTRIFUGE \nThe most important components of a centrifuge are the \nfollowing3:\nThe electric\/electronic control which generally has the following elements:1. On and off control, operation time control (timer), \nrotation speed control (in some centrifuges), temperature control (in refrigerated centrifuges), vibration control (safety mechanism) and brake system.2.

It corresponds to the number 6.0225 \u00d7 1023, or Avogadro\u2019s number, also called gram molecule. The mass in grams of this amount of a substance, numerically equal to the molecular weight of the substance, also called gram-molecular weight. pH. Measurement of the concentration of the hydrogen ion (H+) given in moles per litre (M) in a solution. The pH concept was proposed by S\u00f8rensen and Lindstr\u00f8m-\nLang in 1909 to facilitate expressing very low ion concentrations. It is defi  ned by the following equation:pH = \u2013log [H\n+]      or      [H+] = 10-pH \nIt measures the acidity of a solution. Example, in water the concentration of [H+] is 1.0 x 10-7 M resulting in pH = 7. This allows the range of concentrations from \n1 to 10-14 M, to be expressed from zero (0) to 14. There are diverse systems for measuring the acidity of a solution. An acidic substance  dissolved in water is capable \nof producing H+ ions. A basic substance dissolved in water is capable of producing [OH\u2013] (hydroxides) ions. An acid substance has a greater quantity of ions [H+] than pure water; a basic substance shows greater quantities of ions [OH\u2013] than pure water. The concentrations \nof substances are expressed in moles per litre. In pure water, the ion concentration [H+] and [OH\u2013] is 1.0 x 10\u20137 M, it is thus considered a neutral substance. In reality, it is a weak electrolyte that is dissociated \nfollowing the following equation:H\n2O  '  [H+][OH\u2013] \nIn all aqueous solutions there is a balance expressed as:   \n[H+][OH\u2013] = K \n     H2O\nIf the solution is diluted, the concentration of the non-dissociated water can be considered constant:\n[H+][OH\u2013] = [H2O]K = Ka\nThe new constant Ka is called a constant of dissociation or ionic product of water and its value is 1.0x10\u201314 at 25 \u00b0C. [H+][OH\u2013] = 1.0 x 10-14\nX x X = 1.0 x 10-14\nX2 = 1.0 x 10-14\nX = 1.0 x 10-7\nIn pure water the concentrations of H+ and OH\u2013 are 1.0 x 10\u20137 M, a very low concentration, given that the molar concentration of water is 55.4 mol\/litre.

ROUTINE MAINTENANCE\nThe balance is characterized as an instrument of high precision. For this reason, the operator is only responsible \nfor minimal maintenance limited to the following:\nDaily Activities\n1. Clean the weighing plate so that it is kept free of dust. Cleaning is done b y using a piece of clean cloth which \nmay be dampened with distilled water. If there is a stain, a mild detergent can be applied. Also a paintbrush with soft bristles can be used to remove particles or dust deposited on the weight plate. 2. Clean the weighing chamber, externally and internally. Verify that the glass is free from dust. 3. Verify that the adjustment mechanisms on the front \ndoor of the weighing chamber works adequately.4. Always use a clean, pre-weighed container for weighing \n(glass container or weighing paper if possible).

Power:  Single phase Voltage: 110 V or 220-230 V Frequencies; \n50-60Hz depending on the World region. There is also portable pH meters powered with batteries. GENERAL CALIBRATION PROCEDURE\npH analyzers must be calibrated before use to guarantee \nthe qualit y and accuracy of the readings following these \nprocedures:1. One point calibration. This is carried out for normal \nworking conditions and for normal use. It uses one known pH reference solution. 2. Two point calibration. This is done prior to performing \nvery precise measurements. It uses two known pH reference solutions. It is also done if the instrument is used sporadically and its maintenance is not carried out frequently.Description of the process\nFrequency: Daily1. Calibr ate the pH meter using one known pH solution \n(one point calibration). 1.1 Connect the equipment to an electrical outlet with \nsuitable voltage. 1.2 A djust the temperature selector to the \nenvironmental temperature. 1.3 Adjust the meter.1.4 Remove the electrodes from the storage container. The electrodes must always be stored in a suitable solution. Some can be maintained in distilled water, others must be kept in a diff  erent solution \nas their manufacturers recommend\n1. If for some \nreason, the electrode becomes dry, it is necessary to soak it for at least 24 hours before use. 1.5 R inse the electrode with distilled water in an empty \nbeaker. 1.6 Dry the electrode with material able to absorb \nresidual liquid on its surface, without impregnating the electrode. To avoid possible contamination, the electrodes must be rinsed between diff  erent \nsolutions. 1 Verify the type of buff  er solution recommended by the electrode \nmanufacturer.MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n172. Place electrodes in the calibration solution. 2.1 Submerge the electrode in the standardization \nsolution in such a manner that its lower extremity does not touch the bottom of the beaker. This decreases the risk of breaking the electrode. If the test requires that the solution be kept in motion using the magnetic agitator, special care must be taken so that the agitation rod does not hit the electrode as this could break it. Buff  er solution \nis used as a calibration solution, because its pH is known and therefore will still be maintained even if a little contamination occurs.

This information, along with good use and care, helps to maintain laboratory equipment in optimal condition.MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n1The microplate reader also known as \u201cPhotometric \nmicro-plate reader or ELISA reader\u201d is a specialized spectrophotometer designed to read results of the ELISA test, a technique used to determine the presence of antibodies or specifi  c antigens in samples. The technique \nis based on the detection of an antigen or antibodies captured on a solid surface using direct or secondary, labelled antibodies, producing a reaction whose product can be read by the spectrophotometer. The word ELISA is the acronym for \u201cEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay\u201d . This chapter covers the use of microplate readers for ELISA testing. For additional information on the instrument principles of operation and maintenance, consult Chapter 11 discussing the spectrophotometer. PHOTOGRAPH OF MICROPLATE READER\nPURPOSE OF THE MICROPLATE READER\nThe microplate reader is used for reading the results of ELISA \ntests. This technique has a direct application in immunology and serology. Among other applications it confi  rms the \npresence of antibodies or antigens of an infectious agent in an organism, antibodies from a vaccine or auto-antibodies, for example in rheumatoid arthritis.OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThe microplate reader is a specialized spectrophotometer. Unlike the c onventional spectrophotometer which facilitates \nreadings on a wide range of wavelengths, the microplate reader has filters or diffraction gratings that limit the wavelength range to that used in ELISA, generally between 400 to 750 nm (nanometres). Some readers operate in the ultraviolet range and carry out analyses between 340 to 700 nm. The optical system exploited by many manufacturers uses optic fi  bres to supply light to the microplate wells \ncontaining the samples. The light beam, passing through the sample has a diameter ranging between 1 to 3 mm. A detection system detects the light coming from the sample, amplifi  es the signal and determines the sample\u2019s \nabsorbance. A reading system converts it into data allowing the test result interpretation. Some microplate readers use double beam light systems. Test samples are located in specially designed plates with \na specifi  c number of wells where the procedure or test is \ncarried out. Plates of 8 columns by 12 rows with a total of 96 wells are common. There are also plates with a greater number of wells. For specialized applications, the current trend is to increase the number of wells (384-well plates) to reduce the amount of reagents and samples used and a greater throughput. The location of the optical sensors of the microplate reader varies depending on the manufacturers: these can be located above the sample plate, or directly underneath the plate\u2019s wells. Nowadays microplate readers have controls regulated by \nmicroprocessors; connection interfaces to information systems; quality and process control programs, which by means of a computer, allow complete test automation.Chapter 1\nMicroplate Reader\nGMDN Code 37036\nECRI Code 16-979\nDenomination Photometric micro-plate reader\nPhoto courtesy of BioRad Laboratories CHAPTER 1  MICROPLATE READER\n2Equipment required for ELISA testing\nIn order to perform the ELISA technique, the following \nequipment is r equired:  \n1.

The screen displays an error code.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Information on the compatibility of the rotor with other \nmodels of centrifuges from the same manufacturer. Recently manufactured centrifuges have incorporated \nnumerous improvements into their design to provide greater safety and longer operational life. Among advances mentioned are controls based on microprocessors. By means of software  controlled by a keyboard, these have several \ndiff erent operational programs in memory. According to the \ntype of rotor being used and procedure conducted, these programs control the centrifugation time, the required temperature, the rotor\u2019s revolutions, the acceleration and deceleration, alarms warning the operator about any anomaly during operation. Manufacturers have also incorporated induction motors \n(without brushes) in centrifuges. These have the advantage of electronically controlling currents and magnetic fields regulating the rotor\u2019s speed which reduces the frequency of maintenance. Operation and maintenance of such equipment must be carried out according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS\nCentrifuges require the following for normal operation:1. An electrical connection with a capacity suitable for the \nequipment providing stable single phase or triphase type voltage (depending on the model and specifi  cation \ngiven by the manufacturer). In general, centrifuges use 110V or 220 V\/60 Hz. 2.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Any spill must be cleaned immediately to avoid corrosion \nor contamination. Use 70% ethanol to disinfect the pan of the balance. Very important:  Never lubricate a balance unless the \nmanufacturer has expressly indicated it.

The water distiller, also called distillation unit or water still, used in the laboratory, purifi  es running water by means of controlled \nvaporization and cooling processes. Upon applying thermal energy to water in a liquid phase by a warming process, it is changed into vapour. This allows the water molecules to separate from the molecules of other substances mixed or diluted. The water vapour is collected and passed through a condenser, where it is cooled and returned to the liquid phase. Then, the condensed water is collected into a diff  erent storage tank. Distilled water shows pure \ncharacteristics compared to running water; it is practically free of contaminating substances.PURPOSE OF THE WATER DISTILLER\nThe water distiller facilitates obtaining very pure water from potable wat er normally provided by the aqueduct services \nin urban centres. Distilled water is characterized by a lack of solids in suspension. It is used in multiple applications in centres which provide health services, especially in laboratory units, in washing, sterilization and dietetics. The more specialized the procedures are in the laboratory, the greater will be the level of purity required. For example: the preparation of reagents or biological material requires water of the highest quality. Distillation is one of the fundamental processes to achieve this (although it may not be the only one required). Water used in laboratories must be free of pyrogens, with a concentration of total solids no greater than 1 ppm, a pH value between 5.4 and 7.2 and an electrical resistance of at least 3 x 10\n5 ohm\/cm at 25 \u00b0C1. 1 Warming cabinets, sterilizers, and associated equipment , Division 11\u2013 \nEquipment, USACE\/NAVFAC\/ AFCESA, UFGS-11710, July 2003.

A deviation in the results when an object is weighed placing it in diff  erent parts of the weighing plate, i.e. in the centre o f the plate and on \none of its sides. Linear error. A diff  erence showed when the balance is loaded in a successive manner, increasing the quantity of weight in equal magnitude un til it reaches its \nmaximum capacity and unloaded in an analogous process. The diff  erences shown between the readings obtained and the arithmetic v alues corresponding to the \nweights used are interpreted as non-linearity. Linearity. Refers to the ability of a balance to perform  accurate readings of weights throughout its weighing capacity . A graph showing  weight compared to the \nweight indication on a perfectly linear balance should generate a straight line. In order to determine the linear error of a ba lance, certifi  ed masses must be used. The procedure allows the linear diff  erences to be calculated by reading certifi  ed masses with and without preloading. The diff  e rence between the readings allows \nthe linear error to be calculated. Mass.

A clean, dust free environment.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>5. Substitution Balance (Unequal-lever arm or two-\nknife balance). This is a balance with a single plate. An unknown mass is placed on the weighing plate. It is weighed by removing known masses from the counterweight side until it reaches a balanced position, using a mechanical system of cams. The fulcrum is generally off  -centre in relation to the length of the load \nbeam and located near the front of the balance. When a mass is placed on the weight plate and the balance\u2019s locking mechanism is released, the movement of the load beam is projected through an optical system to a screen located on the front part of the instrument. Operation veri\ufb01  cation\nThe procedure used for verifying the functioning of a typical \nmechanical balanc e is described below. The described \nprocess is based on the substitution balance.1. Verify that the balance is levelled. The levelling is \nachieved using a ring-shaped adjustment mechanism located on the base of the balance or by adjusting a bubble or knob on a scale located on the front of the balance\u2019s base. 2. Test the  zero mechanism. Place the controls on zero \nand free the balance. If the reading does not stay at zero, adjust the zero mechanism (a grooved screw located in a horizontal position near the fulcrum). To do this, it is necessary to block the balance and slightly adjust the mechanism. The process is to be continued until the zero adjusts correctly on the reading scale.3. Verify and adjust the sensitivity. This is always readjusted \nwhenever some internal adjustment is done. It is performed with a known standard according to the following steps:\na) Lock the balance.b) Place a standard weight (equivalent to the optical \nscale range) on the plate. c) Position the micro setting to one (1). d) Release the balance. e) Adjust to the zero position.f) Position the micro setting to zero (0). The balance \nshould indicate 100. If the scale displays less or more than 100, the sensitivity control must be adjusted. This requires locking the balance, opening the upper cover and turning the sensitivity screw: If the scale registers more than 100; turn the screw in a clockwise position. If the scale registers less than 100, it is necessary to unwind the screw anticlockwise. Repeat the process until the balance is adjusted (adjusting the zero and the sensitivity).Type of mass Capacity\nSimple pieces \n 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 g \n100, 200 and 500 g \nFractional pieces \n 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 mg \n100, 200 and 500 mg \nMass\nPlate\nFlexible\nConnections\nSupport ColumnFGFigure 10.

The microplate washer performs the washing of the ELISA plate\u2019s wells during the diff  erent stages of the technique. PHOTOGRAPH OF MICROPLATE WASHER \nPURPOSE OF THE MICROPLATE WASHER \nThe microplate washer has been designed to supply cleaning \nbuff ers required for the ELISA technique in a controlled \nmanner. In the same fashion, the equipment removes from each well, substances in excess from the reaction. Depending on the test performed, the washer can intervene from one to four times, supplying the washing buff  er, agitating and \nremoving the unbound reagents\n1 until the programmed \ntimes and cycles are completed. The washer has of two reservoirs; one for the washing buff  er, the other for the waste \ngenerated during the washing process.OPERATION PRINCIPLES \nThe microplate washer has been designed to perform washing operations in the ELISA t echnique. The equipment \npossesses at least, the following subsystems which vary depending on the manufacturer\u2019s design. \u2022\u2022 Control subsystem. Generally , the washer is controlled \nby microprocessors allowing programming and controlling steps to be performed by the washer such as: number of washing cycles\n2 (1\u20135); expected times; \nsupplying and extracting pressures; plate format (96\u2013384 wells); suction function adjustment according to the type of well\n3 (fl at bottom, V bottom or rounded \nbottom or strips used); volumes distributed or aspirated; the soaking and agitation cycles, etc. \u2022\u2022 Supply subsystem. In general, this comprises a reservoir \nfor the washing solution; one or several pumps; usually a positive displacement type syringe and a dispenser head that supplies the washing solution to the diff  erent \nwells by means of needles. The head usually comes with eight pairs of needles for washing and aspirating simultaneously the wells of the same row (the supply and extraction sub-systems converge on the head). There are models with twelve pairs of needles and others that conduct the washing process simultaneously in all the wells. Some washers off  er the possibility of working \nwith diff  erent types of washing solutions, performing \nthe solution changes according to the program entered by the operator. 1 See a brief explication of the ELISA technique in Chapter 1, Microplate \nReader . 2 The exact number of washing operations required depends on the assay \nused.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>9.

A quantity of any substance whose mass expressed in grams is numerically equal to its atomic mass. Mole (unit). The amount of a substance that contains as many atoms, molecules, ions, or other elementary units as the number of atoms in 0. 012 kilogram of \ncarbon 12. It corresponds to the number 6.0225 \u00d7 1023, or Avogadro\u2019s number, also called gram molecule. The mass in grams of this amount of a substance, numerically equal to the molecular weight of the substance, also called gram-molecular weight. pH. Measurement of the concentration of the hydrogen ion (H+) given in moles per litre (M) in a solution. The pH concept was proposed by S\u00f8rensen and Lindstr\u00f8m-\nLang in 1909 to facilitate expressing very low ion concentrations. It is defi  ned by the following equation:pH = \u2013log [H\n+]      or      [H+] = 10-pH \nIt measures the acidity of a solution. Example, in water the concentration of [H+] is 1.0 x 10-7 M resulting in pH = 7. This allows the range of concentrations from \n1 to 10-14 M, to be expressed from zero (0) to 14. There are diverse systems for measuring the acidity of a solution. An acidic substance  dissolved in water is capable \nof producing H+ ions. A basic substance dissolved in water is capable of producing [OH\u2013] (hydroxides) ions. An acid substance has a greater quantity of ions [H+] than pure water; a basic substance shows greater quantities of ions [OH\u2013] than pure water. The concentrations \nof substances are expressed in moles per litre. In pure water, the ion concentration [H+] and [OH\u2013] is 1.0 x 10\u20137 M, it is thus considered a neutral substance. In reality, it is a weak electrolyte that is dissociated \nfollowing the following equation:H\n2O  '  [H+][OH\u2013] \nIn all aqueous solutions there is a balance expressed as:   \n[H+][OH\u2013] = K \n     H2O\nIf the solution is diluted, the concentration of the non-dissociated water can be considered constant:\n[H+][OH\u2013] = [H2O]K = Ka\nThe new constant Ka is called a constant of dissociation or ionic product of water and its value is 1.0x10\u201314 at 25 \u00b0C. [H+][OH\u2013] = 1.0 x 10-14\nX x X = 1.0 x 10-14\nX2 = 1.0 x 10-14\nX = 1.0 x 10-7\nIn pure water the concentrations of H+ and OH\u2013 are 1.0 x 10\u20137 M, a very low concentration, given that the molar concentration of water is 55.4 mol\/litre.

The results obtained must be analyzed to determine if these are within the acceptable tolerances. The standard weights must be selected based on the balance\u2019s capacity. The above table complements the previous. It provides guidance in determining the standard weights to use in the calibration of a balance according to its capacity. ROUTINE MAINTENANCE\nThe balance is characterized as an instrument of high precision. For this reason, the operator is only responsible \nfor minimal maintenance limited to the following:\nDaily Activities\n1. Clean the weighing plate so that it is kept free of dust. Cleaning is done b y using a piece of clean cloth which \nmay be dampened with distilled water. If there is a stain, a mild detergent can be applied. Also a paintbrush with soft bristles can be used to remove particles or dust deposited on the weight plate. 2. Clean the weighing chamber, externally and internally. Verify that the glass is free from dust. 3. Verify that the adjustment mechanisms on the front \ndoor of the weighing chamber works adequately.4. Always use a clean, pre-weighed container for weighing \n(glass container or weighing paper if possible). Note that plastic can become electromagnetically charged and is not recommended for weighing powdered or granulated chemicals. 5.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>2.

Its purpose is to give a better \nunderstanding of the technical requirements regarding installation, use and maintenance of various types of equipment which play an important role in performing diagnostic testing. The manual also aims to provide support to personnel responsible for technical management, implementation of quality management and maintenance. Due to the diversity of origins, brands and models, this manual off  ers general recommendations. Equipment-specifi  c details \nare explained in depth in the maintenance and installation user manuals from manufacturers. These should be requested and ordered through the procurement processes of the individual agencies and professionals responsible for the acquisition of technology, or directly from the manufacturer. This manual was originally developed by the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) to support improved quality \nprogrammes which PAHO promotes in regional laboratories. The English version was produced by WHO to further expand support for quality programmes in other regions. The revised edition now includes 20 equipment groups selected to cover those most commonly used in low to medium technical complexity laboratories across the world. Given the diff  erences in \ntechnical complexity, brands and existing models, each chapter has been developed with basic equipment in mind, including new technology where relevant. The following information is included in each chapter: \n\u2022\u2022 Groups of equipment, organized by their generic names. Alternative names have also been included. \u2022\u2022 Photographs or diagrams, or a combination of both t o identify the type of equipment under consideration. \u2022\u2022 A brief explanation on the main uses or applications of the equipment in the laboratory. \u2022\u2022 A basic description of the principles by which the equipment operates with explanations of principles or physical and\/or \nchemical la ws which the interested reader can \u2013 or should study in depth. \u2022\u2022 Installation requirements with emphasis on the electrical aspects and the r equirements for safe installation and operation, \nincluding worldwide electrical standards. \u2022\u2022 Basic routine maintenance, classifi  ed according to the required frequency (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually \nor sporadically). The procedures are numbered and presented in the actual sequence in which these should take place (model-specifi  c procedures can be found in the manuals published by the manufacturers). \u2022\u2022 Troubleshooting tables with the most frequent problems aff  ecting the equipment with possible causes and actions that \nmay resolve these problems. \u2022\u2022 A list of basic defi  nitions of some of the specialized terms used.<\/DOCUMENT>\n1.

Avoid locating it directly under the air-conditioning \nsystem (air currents) and sunlight. 5. An electrical outlet which complies with the current \nelectrical standards in the country or the laboratory. It must be in good condition and equipped with a ground pole and switches.Electronic balance operation\nThe operation of a modern electronic balance is clearly detailed in its operat or\u2019s manual from the manufacturer. In \ngeneral, it must conform to the following procedure:1. Allow the balance to equilibrate with the environment \nwhere it is installed. 2. Allow the balance to warm-up before initiating activities. Normally it is suffi   cient to have it connected to the \nelectrical feed system. Some manufacturers suggest at least 20 minutes from the moment it is energized until use. Analytical balances Class 1 require at least 2 hours for warming before initiating use. Verify that the balance is calibrated. Electronic \nbalances generally have a factory-made calibration stored in memory which can be used if it does not have calibration masses. If calibration is required, use calibrated masses as indicated by the manufacturer. The calibrated masses must conform or exceed the ASTM tolerances. For general information, the following table shows the accepted tolerance for the ASTM Class 1\n1 \nmasses. 3.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Air supply.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>7.

The rotors generally made of aluminium [Al] are \ncovered by a fi  lm of anodized aluminium which protects \ntheir metal structure. 9. Use plastic brushes when cleaning the rotor. Metal \nbrushes scratch the protective coating and generate sources for future corrosion. Corrosion is accelerated in operation conditions and shortens the rotor\u2019s operational life. 10. If there are spills of corrosive substances, wash the rotor \nimmediately. 11. Air dry the rotor once cleaned and washed with water.12. Store vertical tube rotors and almost vertical tube rotors \nwith the larger side facing downwards and without their covers. 13. Store rotors in a dry area. Avoid leaving them in the \ncentrifuge. 14. Store swinging buckets rotors without the compartments\u2019 \ncovers. 15. Lubricate spiral and O-rings, according to the \nmanufacturer\u2019s recommendation. 16. Observe re commendations related to guaranteed times \nand operational life of each type of rotor. 17.

Never try to open the cover of a centrifuge while it is \nfunctioning and never try to stop the rotor by hand. Tubes \nTube care includes aspects such as fi  lling of the tubes, adequat e temperature selection, centrifugation speed \nlimitations, washing and sterilization. The principle recommendations are the following:1. Wash tubes, adaptors and other accessories by hand \nusing a 1:10 mild detergent solution in water and a soft textured brush (not metallic). Avoid using automatic dishwashers. 2. Avoid using alcohol and acetone since such liquids aff  ect \nthe structure of the tubes. Manufacturers recommend the solvent to be used with each type of centrifugation tube material. 3. Avoid drying tubes in a drying oven. Dry always with a \nstream of hot air.4. Verify if the tubes are reusable or not. If they are \ndisposable, use them only once. 5. For sterilizing, it is necessary to verify the material from \nwhich the tube is made, as not all can stand sterilization by heat. Glass tubes are normally sterilized with vapour at 121 \u00b0C for 30 minutes. 6. Store tubes and bottles in a dark, fresh, dry place, \nfar from chemical vapours or ultraviolet radiation sources. 7. Verify maximum fi  lling levels and the sealing of thin \nwall tubes in order to avoid collapse inside the rotor by the action of the centrifugal force. Comply with manufacturers recommendations. Preventive maintenance\nWarning:  Nev er carry out a technical intervention in a \ncentrifuge if it has not been previously decontaminated. The most important maintenance routines performed on a \ncentrifuge are the following:Frequency: Monthly1. Verify that the centrifuge external components are free \nof dust and stains. Avoid aff  ecting the rotor with spills. Clean the rotor compartment using a mild detergent. 2. Test that the rotors\u2019 connecting and adjustment \nmechanisms are in good condition.

OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nWater baths are made of steel and are generally c overed with electrostatic paint \nwith high adherence and resistance to environmental laboratory conditions. Water baths have an external panel on which the controls can be found. They also have a tank made of rustproof material with a collection of electrical resistors mounted on their lower part. By means of these, heat is transferred to the medium (water or oil) until reaching the temperature selected with a control device (thermostat or similar). The resistors may be of the following types:\u2022 Immersion type. These resistors are installed inside \na sealed tube and located on the lower part of the container in direct contact with heating medium. \u2022\u2022 External. These resistors are located on the lower part \nbut on the outside of the tank. These are protected by an isolating material which prevents heat loss. This type of resistor transfers the heat to the bottom of the tank through thermal conduction. The water bath is an instrument used in the laboratory for\n \u2022\n\u2022\nImmersion type.

Immersion and external resistors    CHAPTER 5  WATER BATHS\n32Certain types of water bath have a series of accessories such \nas agitation systems or circulators, generating carefully controlled movement of the heating medium to keep the temperature uniform. A table which describes the main types of water baths is shown below. WATER BATH CONTROLS\nWater baths generally have very simple controls. Some manufacturers have incorporated controls with \nmicroprocessors. They vary depending on the type of bath. The diagram of a basic water bath\u2019s control panel is shown next. The control panel has these elements:\n1. The on and off   control switch\n2. A Menu button for selecting the operation\u2019s parameters: \noperation temperature, alarm temperature, temperature scale (\u00b0C, \u00b0F)\n3. Two buttons for parameter adjustment4. A screen 5. A pilot light6. Pilots (2) for identifying the temperature scale (\u00b0C, \u00b0F). WATER BATH OPERATION\nInstallation\n1. Install the water bath close to an electrical outlet. The \noutlet must ha ve its respective ground pole in order \nto guarantee the protection and safety of the operator and the equipment. Water baths generally operate at 120 V\/60 Hz or 230 V\/60Hz. Its installation and use is facilitated by a sink close by for supplying and draining of water. 2. Verify that the location selected is levelled and has the \nnecessary resistance to safely support the weight of the water bath when it is full of liquid. 3. Ensure that the location has a suitable amount of space \nfor putting the samples and the accessories required for the normal operation of the water bath. 4. Avoid placing the water bath where there are strong air \ncurrents which can interfere with its normal operation. For example: in front of an air-conditioning unit or window. Safety\n1. Avoid the use of the water bath in environments where \nther e are fl  ammable and combustible materials. The \nequipment has components (resistors generating very high temperatures) which could start an accidental fi  re \nor explosion. 2. Always connect the equipment to an electrical outlet \nwith a ground pole to protect the user and the equipment from electrical discharges. The electrical connection must comply with the required norms of the country and the laboratory. 3. Use the water bath exclusively with non-corrosive or \nnon-fl  ammable liquids. 4. Use personal protective elements when working with \nthe water bath. The bath has resistors which can cause burns if inadvertently touched, even a considerable time after turning off   the equipment. 5. When working with substances that generate vapours, \nplace the water bath under a chemical hood or in a well ventilated area. 6. Remember that liquids incubated in the water bath tank \ncan produce burns if hands are inadvertently placed inside it. 7. Take into account that the water bath is designed for \nuse with a liquid inside the tank. If the inside is dry, the temperature of the tank can become very high. Use the diff  using tray for placing the container inside of the \nfi lled tank of the water bath. This has been designed for \ndistributing the temperature in a uniform way. 8. Avoid using the water bath if any of its controls is not \nworking, e.g. the temperature or limit controls.Class Temperature range \nLow temperature  Room temperature up to 60 \u00b0C \nRoom temperature up to 100 \u00b0C\nHigh temperature Room temperature up to 275 \u00b0C. When it needs to \nreach temperatures above 100 \u00b0C, it is necessary to use fl  uids other than water as the boiling point of water is 100 \u00b0C under normal conditions\nThis type of bath generally uses oils which have much \nhigher boiling points.

The unit for expressing mass is the kilogram [kg]. OIML.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>3.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>The balance has other names \nsuch as scale and weight. It must be taken into account that the weight is the force which the gravitational fi  eld exercises on a body\u2019s mass, this force being the product of the mass \nby the local acceleration of gravity [F = m x g]. The term local is used to emphasize that this acceleration depends on factors such as the geographical latitude, altitude and the Earth\u2019s density where the measurement is taken. This force is measured in Newtons.

In the laboratory, the balance is used \nfor weighing as part of quality control activities (on devices like pipettes), in the preparation of mixtures of components in predefined proportions and in the determination of specifi  c densities or weights. OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThere are diff  erences in design, principles and criteria of \nmetrology amongst balances. At present, there are two large groups of balances: mechanical and electronic balances. Mechanical balances \nThe following are some of the more common ones: 1. Spring balance. Its function is based on a mechanical \nproperty of springs as the force exercised on a spring is proportional to the spring\u2019s elasticity constant [k], multiplied by its elongation [x] [F = -kx]. The greater the mass [m] placed on the balance\u2019s plate, the greater the elongation will be, given that the elongation is proportional to the mass and the spring\u2019s constant. The calibration of a spring balance depends on the force of gravity acting on the object weighed. This type of balance is used when great precision is not necessary. 2. Sliding weight balance. This type of balance is \nequipped with two known weights which can be moved on setting scales (one macro, the other micro). Upon placing a substance of unknown mass on the tray, its weight is determined by moving the weight on both setting scales until the equilibrium position is reached. At this point, the weight is obtained by adding both quantities indicated by the sliding masses\u2019 position on the scale. 3. Analytical balance. This balance functions by comparing \nknown weight masses with that of a substance of unknown weight. It is composed of a base on a bar or symmetrical lever, maintained by a blade-like support on a central point called a fulcrum. At its ends, there are stirrups, also supported with blades which allow these to oscillate smoothly. From there, two plates are suspended. Certifi  ed weights are placed on one \nof the plates and unknown weights on the other. The balance has a securing system or lock, which allows the main lever to remain stable when not in use or when it is necessary to modify the counter-weights. The balance is inside an external box which protects it from interferences, such as air currents. Analytical balances can weigh ten thousandths of a gram (0.0001 g) or 100 thousandths of a gram (0.00001 g). This type of balance generally has a capacity of up to 200 grams.

Analytical balance  MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n23It is necessary to have a set of certifi  ed masses. The set is \ngenerally composed of the following pieces:\n4. Upper plate balance (Top loading or parallel guidance \nbalance). This type of balance has a loading plate located \non its upper part, supported by a column maintained in a vertical position by two pairs of guides with fl  exible \nconnections. The eff  ect of the force produced by the \nmass is transmitted from a point on the vertical column directly or by some mechanical means to the loading cell. The requirement with this type of mechanism is that parallel guides must be maintained with exactitude of up to \u00b1 1  \u00b5m. Deviations in parallelism cause an error known \nas lateral load (when the mass being weighed shows diff erences if the reading is taken at the centre of the \nplate or on one of its sides). The diagram shown below explains the operation principle some manufacturers have introduced in electronic balances.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>4. Put the main switch N\u00ba 1 in the ON position (the \nnumbers identifying the controls herein correspond to those shown in the diagram).

Select the operation temperature using the Menu N\u00ba 2 \nbutton and the buttons for adjusting the parameters. 6. Select the cut-off   temperature (in water baths with this \ncontrol).
