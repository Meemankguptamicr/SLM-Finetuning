The water distiller, also called distillation unit or water still, used in the laboratory, purifi  es running water by means of controlled \nvaporization and cooling processes. Upon applying thermal energy to water in a liquid phase by a warming process, it is changed into vapour. This allows the water molecules to separate from the molecules of other substances mixed or diluted. The water vapour is collected and passed through a condenser, where it is cooled and returned to the liquid phase. Then, the condensed water is collected into a diff  erent storage tank. Distilled water shows pure \ncharacteristics compared to running water; it is practically free of contaminating substances.PURPOSE OF THE WATER DISTILLER\nThe water distiller facilitates obtaining very pure water from potable wat er normally provided by the aqueduct services \nin urban centres. Distilled water is characterized by a lack of solids in suspension. It is used in multiple applications in centres which provide health services, especially in laboratory units, in washing, sterilization and dietetics. The more specialized the procedures are in the laboratory, the greater will be the level of purity required. For example: the preparation of reagents or biological material requires water of the highest quality. Distillation is one of the fundamental processes to achieve this (although it may not be the only one required).

The pressure decreases until it reaches the vapour pre ssure of the fl  uid. This produces diverse phenomena such as vaporization of gases dissolved in the liquid or, in the case of water, the formation o f vapour bubbles collapsing after an \ninfi  nitesimal time lapse, perforating the surfaces of conducts in the immediate vicinity. This occurs in dilutors when using la rge capacity syringes with elevated \npropulsion speed. Concentration. A quantity measurement of a chemical substance present in a solution. The concept is expressed as the quantity of a substance dissolved into a \nsolvent. Concentration is expressed in diverse forms; the most common are: molarity [M], molality [m], normality [N], percentag e rate of solute. Dilution. To reduce the concentration of a solution by adding other fl  uids. The fl  uid added is known as the diluent . Adding the molecules of a liquid substance with \nthe molecules of another liquid substance.

After this, let the air fl  ow through.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Place the calibration plate on the equipment. 2. Carry out a complete reading with the calibration plate. Verify if there are diff  erences in the readings obtained \nfrom well to well. If this is the case, invert the plate (180\u00b0) and repeat the reading to rule out that diff  erences are \nattributed to the plate itself. In general, it is accepted that the instrument does not need further calibration if the plate results are as expected at two wavelengths. 3. Verify if the reader requires calibration. If so, proceed \nwith the calibration following the routine outlined by the manufacturer, verifying that the reading\u2019s linearity is maintained as rigorously as possible. 4. If the instrument does not have a calibration plate, verify \nit by placing a coloured solution in the wells of a plate and immediately carry out a complete reading. Then invert the plate 180\u00b0 and read the plate again. If both readings display identical, average values in each row, the reader is calibrated. 5. Verify that the reader is calibrated, column by column. Place a clean, empty plate and carry out a reading. If there is no diff  erence between each of the average \nreading of the fi  rst to the last column, it can be assumed \nthat the reader is calibrated. ROUTINE MAINTENANCE \nMaintenance described next focuses exclusively on the micr oplate reader. The maintenance of the microplate \nwasher is described in Chapter 2. Basic maintenance \nFrequency: Daily1. Review that optical sensors of each channel are clean. If dirt is detected, clean the surface of the windows of the light emitters and the sensors with a small brush. 2. Confi  rm that the lighting system is clean. 3. Verify that the reader\u2019s calibration is adequate. When \nthe daily operations begin, let the reader warm up for 30 minutes. Next, do a blank reading and then read a full plate of substrate. The readings must be identical. If not, invert the plate and repeat the reading in order to determine if the deviation originated in the plate or the reader. 4. Examine the automatic drawer sliding system. It must \nbe smooth and constant.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Diff using tray.

This information, along with good use and care, helps to maintain laboratory equipment in optimal condition.MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n1The microplate reader also known as \u201cPhotometric \nmicro-plate reader or ELISA reader\u201d is a specialized spectrophotometer designed to read results of the ELISA test, a technique used to determine the presence of antibodies or specifi  c antigens in samples. The technique \nis based on the detection of an antigen or antibodies captured on a solid surface using direct or secondary, labelled antibodies, producing a reaction whose product can be read by the spectrophotometer. The word ELISA is the acronym for \u201cEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay\u201d . This chapter covers the use of microplate readers for ELISA testing. For additional information on the instrument principles of operation and maintenance, consult Chapter 11 discussing the spectrophotometer. PHOTOGRAPH OF MICROPLATE READER\nPURPOSE OF THE MICROPLATE READER\nThe microplate reader is used for reading the results of ELISA \ntests. This technique has a direct application in immunology and serology. Among other applications it confi  rms the \npresence of antibodies or antigens of an infectious agent in an organism, antibodies from a vaccine or auto-antibodies, for example in rheumatoid arthritis.OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThe microplate reader is a specialized spectrophotometer. Unlike the c onventional spectrophotometer which facilitates \nreadings on a wide range of wavelengths, the microplate reader has filters or diffraction gratings that limit the wavelength range to that used in ELISA, generally between 400 to 750 nm (nanometres). Some readers operate in the ultraviolet range and carry out analyses between 340 to 700 nm. The optical system exploited by many manufacturers uses optic fi  bres to supply light to the microplate wells \ncontaining the samples. The light beam, passing through the sample has a diameter ranging between 1 to 3 mm. A detection system detects the light coming from the sample, amplifi  es the signal and determines the sample\u2019s \nabsorbance. A reading system converts it into data allowing the test result interpretation. Some microplate readers use double beam light systems. Test samples are located in specially designed plates with \na specifi  c number of wells where the procedure or test is \ncarried out. Plates of 8 columns by 12 rows with a total of 96 wells are common. There are also plates with a greater number of wells. For specialized applications, the current trend is to increase the number of wells (384-well plates) to reduce the amount of reagents and samples used and a greater throughput. The location of the optical sensors of the microplate reader varies depending on the manufacturers: these can be located above the sample plate, or directly underneath the plate\u2019s wells. Nowadays microplate readers have controls regulated by \nmicroprocessors; connection interfaces to information systems; quality and process control programs, which by means of a computer, allow complete test automation.Chapter 1\nMicroplate Reader\nGMDN Code 37036\nECRI Code 16-979\nDenomination Photometric micro-plate reader\nPhoto courtesy of BioRad Laboratories CHAPTER 1  MICROPLATE READER\n2Equipment required for ELISA testing\nIn order to perform the ELISA technique, the following \nequipment is r equired:  \n1.

This information, along with good use and care, helps to maintain laboratory equipment in optimal condition.MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n1The microplate reader also known as \u201cPhotometric \nmicro-plate reader or ELISA reader\u201d is a specialized spectrophotometer designed to read results of the ELISA test, a technique used to determine the presence of antibodies or specifi  c antigens in samples. The technique \nis based on the detection of an antigen or antibodies captured on a solid surface using direct or secondary, labelled antibodies, producing a reaction whose product can be read by the spectrophotometer. The word ELISA is the acronym for \u201cEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay\u201d . This chapter covers the use of microplate readers for ELISA testing. For additional information on the instrument principles of operation and maintenance, consult Chapter 11 discussing the spectrophotometer. PHOTOGRAPH OF MICROPLATE READER\nPURPOSE OF THE MICROPLATE READER\nThe microplate reader is used for reading the results of ELISA \ntests. This technique has a direct application in immunology and serology. Among other applications it confi  rms the \npresence of antibodies or antigens of an infectious agent in an organism, antibodies from a vaccine or auto-antibodies, for example in rheumatoid arthritis.OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThe microplate reader is a specialized spectrophotometer. Unlike the c onventional spectrophotometer which facilitates \nreadings on a wide range of wavelengths, the microplate reader has filters or diffraction gratings that limit the wavelength range to that used in ELISA, generally between 400 to 750 nm (nanometres). Some readers operate in the ultraviolet range and carry out analyses between 340 to 700 nm. The optical system exploited by many manufacturers uses optic fi  bres to supply light to the microplate wells \ncontaining the samples. The light beam, passing through the sample has a diameter ranging between 1 to 3 mm. A detection system detects the light coming from the sample, amplifi  es the signal and determines the sample\u2019s \nabsorbance. A reading system converts it into data allowing the test result interpretation. Some microplate readers use double beam light systems. Test samples are located in specially designed plates with \na specifi  c number of wells where the procedure or test is \ncarried out. Plates of 8 columns by 12 rows with a total of 96 wells are common. There are also plates with a greater number of wells. For specialized applications, the current trend is to increase the number of wells (384-well plates) to reduce the amount of reagents and samples used and a greater throughput. The location of the optical sensors of the microplate reader varies depending on the manufacturers: these can be located above the sample plate, or directly underneath the plate\u2019s wells. Nowadays microplate readers have controls regulated by \nmicroprocessors; connection interfaces to information systems; quality and process control programs, which by means of a computer, allow complete test automation.Chapter 1\nMicroplate Reader\nGMDN Code 37036\nECRI Code 16-979\nDenomination Photometric micro-plate reader\nPhoto courtesy of BioRad Laboratories CHAPTER 1  MICROPLATE READER\n2Equipment required for ELISA testing\nIn order to perform the ELISA technique, the following \nequipment is r equired:  \n1.

In the laboratory, the balance is used \nfor weighing as part of quality control activities (on devices like pipettes), in the preparation of mixtures of components in predefined proportions and in the determination of specifi  c densities or weights. OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThere are diff  erences in design, principles and criteria of \nmetrology amongst balances. At present, there are two large groups of balances: mechanical and electronic balances. Mechanical balances \nThe following are some of the more common ones: 1. Spring balance. Its function is based on a mechanical \nproperty of springs as the force exercised on a spring is proportional to the spring\u2019s elasticity constant [k], multiplied by its elongation [x] [F = -kx]. The greater the mass [m] placed on the balance\u2019s plate, the greater the elongation will be, given that the elongation is proportional to the mass and the spring\u2019s constant. The calibration of a spring balance depends on the force of gravity acting on the object weighed. This type of balance is used when great precision is not necessary. 2. Sliding weight balance. This type of balance is \nequipped with two known weights which can be moved on setting scales (one macro, the other micro). Upon placing a substance of unknown mass on the tray, its weight is determined by moving the weight on both setting scales until the equilibrium position is reached. At this point, the weight is obtained by adding both quantities indicated by the sliding masses\u2019 position on the scale. 3. Analytical balance. This balance functions by comparing \nknown weight masses with that of a substance of unknown weight. It is composed of a base on a bar or symmetrical lever, maintained by a blade-like support on a central point called a fulcrum. At its ends, there are stirrups, also supported with blades which allow these to oscillate smoothly. From there, two plates are suspended. Certifi  ed weights are placed on one \nof the plates and unknown weights on the other. The balance has a securing system or lock, which allows the main lever to remain stable when not in use or when it is necessary to modify the counter-weights. The balance is inside an external box which protects it from interferences, such as air currents. Analytical balances can weigh ten thousandths of a gram (0.0001 g) or 100 thousandths of a gram (0.00001 g). This type of balance generally has a capacity of up to 200 grams.

Upper plate balance (Top loading or parallel guidance \nbalance). This type of balance has a loading plate located \non its upper part, supported by a column maintained in a vertical position by two pairs of guides with fl  exible \nconnections. The eff  ect of the force produced by the \nmass is transmitted from a point on the vertical column directly or by some mechanical means to the loading cell. The requirement with this type of mechanism is that parallel guides must be maintained with exactitude of up to \u00b1 1  \u00b5m. Deviations in parallelism cause an error known \nas lateral load (when the mass being weighed shows diff erences if the reading is taken at the centre of the \nplate or on one of its sides).

The balance has a securing system or lock, which allows the main lever to remain stable when not in use or when it is necessary to modify the counter-weights. The balance is inside an external box which protects it from interferences, such as air currents. Analytical balances can weigh ten thousandths of a gram (0.0001 g) or 100 thousandths of a gram (0.00001 g). This type of balance generally has a capacity of up to 200 grams.

Analytical balance  MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n23It is necessary to have a set of certifi  ed masses. The set is \ngenerally composed of the following pieces:\n4. Upper plate balance (Top loading or parallel guidance \nbalance). This type of balance has a loading plate located \non its upper part, supported by a column maintained in a vertical position by two pairs of guides with fl  exible \nconnections. The eff  ect of the force produced by the \nmass is transmitted from a point on the vertical column directly or by some mechanical means to the loading cell. The requirement with this type of mechanism is that parallel guides must be maintained with exactitude of up to \u00b1 1  \u00b5m. Deviations in parallelism cause an error known \nas lateral load (when the mass being weighed shows diff erences if the reading is taken at the centre of the \nplate or on one of its sides).

The mobile parts (weighing plate, support \ncolumn [a], bobbin, position and load indicator [G] -the object in the process of being weighed-) are maintained in equilibrium by a compensation force [F] equal to the weight. The compensation force is generated by an electrical current through a bobbin in the air gap of a cylindrical electromagnet. The force F is calculated with the equation [F = I x L x B] where: I = electrical intensity, L = total length of the wire of the coil and B = magnetic fl  ow intensity in the \nelectromagnet\u2019s air gap.With any change in the load (weight\/mass), the mobile \nmechanical system responds by moving vertically a fraction of distance. Detected by a photosensor [e], an electrical signal is sent to the servo-amplifi  er [f]. This changes the \nfl ow of electrical current passing through the bobbin of the \nmagnet [c] in such a manner that the mobile system returns to the balanced position upon adjusting of the magnetic fl ow in the electromagnet. Consequently, the weight of \nthe mass [G] can be measured indirectly at the start of the electrical current fl  ow, which passes through the circuit \nmeasuring the voltage [V] by means of a precision resistor [R], [V = I x R].

In the laboratory, the balance is used \nfor weighing as part of quality control activities (on devices like pipettes), in the preparation of mixtures of components in predefined proportions and in the determination of specifi  c densities or weights. OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThere are diff  erences in design, principles and criteria of \nmetrology amongst balances. At present, there are two large groups of balances: mechanical and electronic balances. Mechanical balances \nThe following are some of the more common ones: 1. Spring balance. Its function is based on a mechanical \nproperty of springs as the force exercised on a spring is proportional to the spring\u2019s elasticity constant [k], multiplied by its elongation [x] [F = -kx]. The greater the mass [m] placed on the balance\u2019s plate, the greater the elongation will be, given that the elongation is proportional to the mass and the spring\u2019s constant. The calibration of a spring balance depends on the force of gravity acting on the object weighed. This type of balance is used when great precision is not necessary. 2. Sliding weight balance. This type of balance is \nequipped with two known weights which can be moved on setting scales (one macro, the other micro). Upon placing a substance of unknown mass on the tray, its weight is determined by moving the weight on both setting scales until the equilibrium position is reached. At this point, the weight is obtained by adding both quantities indicated by the sliding masses\u2019 position on the scale. 3. Analytical balance. This balance functions by comparing \nknown weight masses with that of a substance of unknown weight. It is composed of a base on a bar or symmetrical lever, maintained by a blade-like support on a central point called a fulcrum. At its ends, there are stirrups, also supported with blades which allow these to oscillate smoothly. From there, two plates are suspended. Certifi  ed weights are placed on one \nof the plates and unknown weights on the other. The balance has a securing system or lock, which allows the main lever to remain stable when not in use or when it is necessary to modify the counter-weights. The balance is inside an external box which protects it from interferences, such as air currents. Analytical balances can weigh ten thousandths of a gram (0.0001 g) or 100 thousandths of a gram (0.00001 g). This type of balance generally has a capacity of up to 200 grams.

Upper plate balance (Top loading or parallel guidance \nbalance). This type of balance has a loading plate located \non its upper part, supported by a column maintained in a vertical position by two pairs of guides with fl  exible \nconnections. The eff  ect of the force produced by the \nmass is transmitted from a point on the vertical column directly or by some mechanical means to the loading cell. The requirement with this type of mechanism is that parallel guides must be maintained with exactitude of up to \u00b1 1  \u00b5m. Deviations in parallelism cause an error known \nas lateral load (when the mass being weighed shows diff erences if the reading is taken at the centre of the \nplate or on one of its sides). The diagram shown below explains the operation principle some manufacturers have introduced in electronic balances.","Risk level 1 group  is composed of biological agents \nvery unlikely to cause sickness in healthy humans or animals.

The cabinets are used for routine work related to pathogens \n(parasites, bacteria, virus, fungus), cell culture and under very precise conditions, the management of toxic agents. OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThe biological safety cabinet is a chamber generally constructed of steel. It has a front glass window of adjustable \nheight, a ventilation system with an electrical motor, a ventilator and a set of ducts which while functioning, generate a negative pressure condition inside the cabinet. This forces the air to fl  ow from inside the cabinet through \nthe front opening to generate a curtain of air protecting the operator. Internally, the air is conducted through a series of grids and ducts to be finally treated in HEPA\n1  \nfi lters. Depending on the design of the cabinet, the air is \nrecycled inside the laboratory or extracted and renewed in diverse proportions. The air fl  ow, which in Class II cabinets \nmoves from the fi  lter towards the work surface, is laminar.

The term local is used to emphasize that this acceleration depends on factors such as the geographical latitude, altitude and the Earth\u2019s density where the measurement is taken.

In the laboratory, the balance is used \nfor weighing as part of quality control activities (on devices like pipettes), in the preparation of mixtures of components in predefined proportions and in the determination of specifi  c densities or weights. OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThere are diff  erences in design, principles and criteria of \nmetrology amongst balances. At present, there are two large groups of balances: mechanical and electronic balances. Mechanical balances \nThe following are some of the more common ones: 1. Spring balance. Its function is based on a mechanical \nproperty of springs as the force exercised on a spring is proportional to the spring\u2019s elasticity constant [k], multiplied by its elongation [x] [F = -kx]. The greater the mass [m] placed on the balance\u2019s plate, the greater the elongation will be, given that the elongation is proportional to the mass and the spring\u2019s constant. The calibration of a spring balance depends on the force of gravity acting on the object weighed. This type of balance is used when great precision is not necessary. 2. Sliding weight balance. This type of balance is \nequipped with two known weights which can be moved on setting scales (one macro, the other micro). Upon placing a substance of unknown mass on the tray, its weight is determined by moving the weight on both setting scales until the equilibrium position is reached. At this point, the weight is obtained by adding both quantities indicated by the sliding masses\u2019 position on the scale. 3. Analytical balance. This balance functions by comparing \nknown weight masses with that of a substance of unknown weight. It is composed of a base on a bar or symmetrical lever, maintained by a blade-like support on a central point called a fulcrum. At its ends, there are stirrups, also supported with blades which allow these to oscillate smoothly. From there, two plates are suspended. Certifi  ed weights are placed on one \nof the plates and unknown weights on the other. The balance has a securing system or lock, which allows the main lever to remain stable when not in use or when it is necessary to modify the counter-weights. The balance is inside an external box which protects it from interferences, such as air currents. Analytical balances can weigh ten thousandths of a gram (0.0001 g) or 100 thousandths of a gram (0.00001 g). This type of balance generally has a capacity of up to 200 grams.

Analytical balance  MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n23It is necessary to have a set of certifi  ed masses. The set is \ngenerally composed of the following pieces:\n4. Upper plate balance (Top loading or parallel guidance \nbalance). This type of balance has a loading plate located \non its upper part, supported by a column maintained in a vertical position by two pairs of guides with fl  exible \nconnections. The eff  ect of the force produced by the \nmass is transmitted from a point on the vertical column directly or by some mechanical means to the loading cell. The requirement with this type of mechanism is that parallel guides must be maintained with exactitude of up to \u00b1 1  \u00b5m. Deviations in parallelism cause an error known \nas lateral load (when the mass being weighed shows diff erences if the reading is taken at the centre of the \nplate or on one of its sides).

The reference electrode is usually made of the same type of material as the internal electrode. Both tubes, interior and exterior, contain a reference solution. Only the outer tube has contact with the measured solution through a porous cap which acts as a saline bridge. This device acts like a galvanized cell. The reference electrode \nis the internal tube of the pH meter probe, which cannot lose ions through interactions with the surrounding environment. Therefore as a reference, it remains static (unchangeable) during the measuring process. The external tube of the probe contains the medium which is allowed  to mix with the external environment. As a result, this tube must be fi lled periodically with a potassium chloride solution (KCI) \nfor restoring the capacity of the electrode which would otherwise be inhibited by a loss of ions and evaporation.

The water distiller, also called distillation unit or water still, used in the laboratory, purifi  es running water by means of controlled \nvaporization and cooling processes. Upon applying thermal energy to water in a liquid phase by a warming process, it is changed into vapour. This allows the water molecules to separate from the molecules of other substances mixed or diluted. The water vapour is collected and passed through a condenser, where it is cooled and returned to the liquid phase. Then, the condensed water is collected into a diff  erent storage tank.

Distilled water is characterized by a lack of solids in suspension. It is used in multiple applications in centres which provide health services, especially in laboratory units, in washing, sterilization and dietetics. The more specialized the procedures are in the laboratory, the greater will be the level of purity required. For example: the preparation of reagents or biological material requires water of the highest quality.

A physical property of the bodies related to the quantity of matter, expressed in kilograms (kg), these contain. In physics, t here are two quantities to which \nthe name mass is given: gravitational mass  which is a measure of the way a body interacts with the gravitational fi  eld (if the body\u2019s mass is small, the body \nexperiences a weaker force than if its mass were greater) and the inertial mass , which is a quantitative or numerical measure of a body\u2019s inertia, that is, of its \nresistance to acceleration. The unit for expressing mass is the kilogram [kg]. OIML.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Verify their integrity. If leaks or any vestiges of corrosion are detected, adjust and\/or replace. 2.

FUNCTIONAL EVALUATION (ALTERNATIVE)\nIn case there are biological safety cabinets in the laboratory, but no authoriz ed certification services available, the \npersonnel responsible for maintenance has the option of conducting annual revision procedures based on Standard NSF 49. Duly documented, it should identify with low levels of uncertainty if the cabinet is in good condition and its operation normal\n2. The following are outlines of how these \nactivities must be done.1. Installation evaluation. Verify that the cabinet \ninstallation conditions are in accordance with the recommendations from the manufacturer. 1 (*) These require specialized decontamination beforehand. 2 The functional evaluation is essentially based on the availability \n(institutional or zonal) of properly trained and experienced technicians and engineers.CHAPTER 6  BIOLOGICAL SAFETY CABINET\n422. Operational evaluation. Test to see if the cabinet is \nworking in accordance with its manufacturing and design characteristics. 3. Performance evaluation. Verify the cabinet\u2019s capacity to \nprovide an adequate work space in normal and critical working conditions.In the following table are featured the parameters to be \ntaken into account in the functional evaluation. These are generally included in inspection forms\n1 designed for this \npurpose.

The most suitable decontamination procedure must be \ndefined by the professional responsible for industrial safety and professional risks. In annex G of the NSF 49 Standard, the procedure for decontaminating the cabinet using depolymerised paraformaldehyde is described. Only professionals who have received the relevant training must conduct such procedures.ROUTINE MAINTENANCE\nWarning:  The maintenance of internal components must \nonly be done by trained and qualifi  ed personnel. In order \nto carry out maintenance on the internal components, decontamination must be done previously. Personal protection must be worn to perform the routines. General maintenance required for the biological safety \ncabinet is for the most part simple to perform. The routines and frequencies are shown below:Frequency: Weekly1. Decontaminate the work surface and the interior \nsurfaces of the cabinet with 70% ethanol. 2. Clean the front glass door and the surface of the \nultraviolet lamp, using a domestic cleaning solution. 3. Verify the precision of the manometer\u2019s reading, \nindicating any fall in pressure fl  owing through the HEPA \nfi lter. Register the date and the reading in the cabinet\u2019s \nlog book.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>To protect the environment. The cabinets are used for routine work related to pathogens \n(parasites, bacteria, virus, fungus), cell culture and under very precise conditions, the management of toxic agents. OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThe biological safety cabinet is a chamber generally constructed of steel. It has a front glass window of adjustable \nheight, a ventilation system with an electrical motor, a ventilator and a set of ducts which while functioning, generate a negative pressure condition inside the cabinet. This forces the air to fl  ow from inside the cabinet through \nthe front opening to generate a curtain of air protecting the operator. Internally, the air is conducted through a series of grids and ducts to be finally treated in HEPA\n1  \nfi lters. Depending on the design of the cabinet, the air is \nrecycled inside the laboratory or extracted and renewed in diverse proportions. The air fl  ow, which in Class II cabinets \nmoves from the fi  lter towards the work surface, is laminar. A \nsummary of the existing type of cabinets and their principal characteristics is presented next. 1 HEPA: High Effi   ciency Particulate Air.

A process through which a fl  uid in liquid phase is heated until converted into vapour and then cooled and condensed back into liquid phase. The \ndistillation process is used for separating mixed substances, taking advantage of their diff  erence in volatility. To obtain ver y pure substances, consecutive distillation \ncycles are performed with the aim of progressively eliminating other substances present in the mix. Hardness (of water). A chemical characteristic of water determined by the carbonate, bicarbonate, chlorine, sulphate and occasionally calcium nitra te and \nmagnesium content. The resulting resistance is undesirable in some processes. There are two types of resistors in water. \u2022 Temporary hardness. This is determined by the magnesium and calcium carbonate and bicarbonate content. It may be eliminated by boiling the water a nd \nsubsequently fi  ltering out the precipitate. It is also known as carbonate resistance. \u2022 Permanent hardness. This is determined by all the calcium and magnesium salts, except the carbonates and bicarbonates. It cannot be eliminated by the \nboiling of water and it is also known as non-bicarbonate resistance.

An unknown mass is placed on the weighing plate. It is weighed by removing known masses from the counterweight side until it reaches a balanced position, using a mechanical system of cams. The fulcrum is generally off  -centre in relation to the length of the load \nbeam and located near the front of the balance. When a mass is placed on the weight plate and the balance\u2019s locking mechanism is released, the movement of the load beam is projected through an optical system to a screen located on the front part of the instrument. Operation veri\ufb01  cation\nThe procedure used for verifying the functioning of a typical \nmechanical balanc e is described below. The described \nprocess is based on the substitution balance.1. Verify that the balance is levelled. The levelling is \nachieved using a ring-shaped adjustment mechanism located on the base of the balance or by adjusting a bubble or knob on a scale located on the front of the balance\u2019s base. 2. Test the  zero mechanism. Place the controls on zero \nand free the balance. If the reading does not stay at zero, adjust the zero mechanism (a grooved screw located in a horizontal position near the fulcrum). To do this, it is necessary to block the balance and slightly adjust the mechanism. The process is to be continued until the zero adjusts correctly on the reading scale.3. Verify and adjust the sensitivity. This is always readjusted \nwhenever some internal adjustment is done. It is performed with a known standard according to the following steps:\na) Lock the balance.b) Place a standard weight (equivalent to the optical \nscale range) on the plate. c) Position the micro setting to one (1). d) Release the balance. e) Adjust to the zero position.f) Position the micro setting to zero (0). The balance \nshould indicate 100. If the scale displays less or more than 100, the sensitivity control must be adjusted. This requires locking the balance, opening the upper cover and turning the sensitivity screw: If the scale registers more than 100; turn the screw in a clockwise position. If the scale registers less than 100, it is necessary to unwind the screw anticlockwise.

In the laboratory, the balance is used \nfor weighing as part of quality control activities (on devices like pipettes), in the preparation of mixtures of components in predefined proportions and in the determination of specifi  c densities or weights. OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThere are diff  erences in design, principles and criteria of \nmetrology amongst balances. At present, there are two large groups of balances: mechanical and electronic balances. Mechanical balances \nThe following are some of the more common ones: 1. Spring balance. Its function is based on a mechanical \nproperty of springs as the force exercised on a spring is proportional to the spring\u2019s elasticity constant [k], multiplied by its elongation [x] [F = -kx]. The greater the mass [m] placed on the balance\u2019s plate, the greater the elongation will be, given that the elongation is proportional to the mass and the spring\u2019s constant. The calibration of a spring balance depends on the force of gravity acting on the object weighed. This type of balance is used when great precision is not necessary. 2. Sliding weight balance. This type of balance is \nequipped with two known weights which can be moved on setting scales (one macro, the other micro). Upon placing a substance of unknown mass on the tray, its weight is determined by moving the weight on both setting scales until the equilibrium position is reached. At this point, the weight is obtained by adding both quantities indicated by the sliding masses\u2019 position on the scale. 3. Analytical balance. This balance functions by comparing \nknown weight masses with that of a substance of unknown weight. It is composed of a base on a bar or symmetrical lever, maintained by a blade-like support on a central point called a fulcrum. At its ends, there are stirrups, also supported with blades which allow these to oscillate smoothly. From there, two plates are suspended. Certifi  ed weights are placed on one \nof the plates and unknown weights on the other. The balance has a securing system or lock, which allows the main lever to remain stable when not in use or when it is necessary to modify the counter-weights. The balance is inside an external box which protects it from interferences, such as air currents. Analytical balances can weigh ten thousandths of a gram (0.0001 g) or 100 thousandths of a gram (0.00001 g). This type of balance generally has a capacity of up to 200 grams.

Upper plate balance (Top loading or parallel guidance \nbalance). This type of balance has a loading plate located \non its upper part, supported by a column maintained in a vertical position by two pairs of guides with fl  exible \nconnections. The eff  ect of the force produced by the \nmass is transmitted from a point on the vertical column directly or by some mechanical means to the loading cell. The requirement with this type of mechanism is that parallel guides must be maintained with exactitude of up to \u00b1 1  \u00b5m. Deviations in parallelism cause an error known \nas lateral load (when the mass being weighed shows diff erences if the reading is taken at the centre of the \nplate or on one of its sides).

Its function is based on a mechanical \nproperty of springs as the force exercised on a spring is proportional to the spring\u2019s elasticity constant [k], multiplied by its elongation [x] [F = -kx]. The greater the mass [m] placed on the balance\u2019s plate, the greater the elongation will be, given that the elongation is proportional to the mass and the spring\u2019s constant. The calibration of a spring balance depends on the force of gravity acting on the object weighed. This type of balance is used when great precision is not necessary. 2. Sliding weight balance. This type of balance is \nequipped with two known weights which can be moved on setting scales (one macro, the other micro). Upon placing a substance of unknown mass on the tray, its weight is determined by moving the weight on both setting scales until the equilibrium position is reached. At this point, the weight is obtained by adding both quantities indicated by the sliding masses\u2019 position on the scale. 3. Analytical balance. This balance functions by comparing \nknown weight masses with that of a substance of unknown weight. It is composed of a base on a bar or symmetrical lever, maintained by a blade-like support on a central point called a fulcrum. At its ends, there are stirrups, also supported with blades which allow these to oscillate smoothly. From there, two plates are suspended. Certifi  ed weights are placed on one \nof the plates and unknown weights on the other. The balance has a securing system or lock, which allows the main lever to remain stable when not in use or when it is necessary to modify the counter-weights. The balance is inside an external box which protects it from interferences, such as air currents. Analytical balances can weigh ten thousandths of a gram (0.0001 g) or 100 thousandths of a gram (0.00001 g). This type of balance generally has a capacity of up to 200 grams.

Analytical balance  MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n23It is necessary to have a set of certifi  ed masses. The set is \ngenerally composed of the following pieces:\n4. Upper plate balance (Top loading or parallel guidance \nbalance). This type of balance has a loading plate located \non its upper part, supported by a column maintained in a vertical position by two pairs of guides with fl  exible \nconnections. The eff  ect of the force produced by the \nmass is transmitted from a point on the vertical column directly or by some mechanical means to the loading cell. The requirement with this type of mechanism is that parallel guides must be maintained with exactitude of up to \u00b1 1  \u00b5m. Deviations in parallelism cause an error known \nas lateral load (when the mass being weighed shows diff erences if the reading is taken at the centre of the \nplate or on one of its sides).

The water distiller, also called distillation unit or water still, used in the laboratory, purifi  es running water by means of controlled \nvaporization and cooling processes. Upon applying thermal energy to water in a liquid phase by a warming process, it is changed into vapour. This allows the water molecules to separate from the molecules of other substances mixed or diluted. The water vapour is collected and passed through a condenser, where it is cooled and returned to the liquid phase. Then, the condensed water is collected into a diff  erent storage tank. Distilled water shows pure \ncharacteristics compared to running water; it is practically free of contaminating substances.PURPOSE OF THE WATER DISTILLER\nThe water distiller facilitates obtaining very pure water from potable wat er normally provided by the aqueduct services \nin urban centres. Distilled water is characterized by a lack of solids in suspension. It is used in multiple applications in centres which provide health services, especially in laboratory units, in washing, sterilization and dietetics. The more specialized the procedures are in the laboratory, the greater will be the level of purity required. For example: the preparation of reagents or biological material requires water of the highest quality. Distillation is one of the fundamental processes to achieve this (although it may not be the only one required). Water used in laboratories must be free of pyrogens, with a concentration of total solids no greater than 1 ppm, a pH value between 5.4 and 7.2 and an electrical resistance of at least 3 x 10\n5 ohm\/cm at 25 \u00b0C1. 1 Warming cabinets, sterilizers, and associated equipment , Division 11\u2013 \nEquipment, USACE\/NAVFAC\/ AFCESA, UFGS-11710, July 2003.

A solution containing either a weak acid and its salt or, a weak base and its salt, which makes it resistant to changes in pH at a given temperature. PBS. One of the solutions used to perform washing operations in ELISA tests. PBS is the acronym for Phosphate Buff  er Solution. This  is made of the following \nsubstances: NaCl, KCl, NaHPO42H2O and KH2SO4. The manufacturers supply technical bulletins which indicate the proportions and instructions for preparing PBS. In \ngeneral, one part of concentrated PBS is mixed with 19 parts of deionised water. Plate (ELISA). Consumable with standard dimensions, designed to hold samples and reactions for the ELISA technique. In general, these have 96 , 384 or 1536 wells \nand are made of plastics such as polystyrene and polypropylene. There are plates specially treated to facilitate the performanc e of the tests. Positive displacement pump. A pump adjusted by a plunger moving along a cylinder. The mechanism is similar to that of a syringe. It is equipped with a set  of \nvalves for controlling the fl  ow to and from the pump. TMB\/H2O2.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Verify the state of gaskets and watertight joints.

Its purpose is to give a better \nunderstanding of the technical requirements regarding installation, use and maintenance of various types of equipment which play an important role in performing diagnostic testing. The manual also aims to provide support to personnel responsible for technical management, implementation of quality management and maintenance. Due to the diversity of origins, brands and models, this manual off  ers general recommendations. Equipment-specifi  c details \nare explained in depth in the maintenance and installation user manuals from manufacturers. These should be requested and ordered through the procurement processes of the individual agencies and professionals responsible for the acquisition of technology, or directly from the manufacturer. This manual was originally developed by the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) to support improved quality \nprogrammes which PAHO promotes in regional laboratories. The English version was produced by WHO to further expand support for quality programmes in other regions. The revised edition now includes 20 equipment groups selected to cover those most commonly used in low to medium technical complexity laboratories across the world. Given the diff  erences in \ntechnical complexity, brands and existing models, each chapter has been developed with basic equipment in mind, including new technology where relevant. The following information is included in each chapter: \n\u2022\u2022 Groups of equipment, organized by their generic names. Alternative names have also been included. \u2022\u2022 Photographs or diagrams, or a combination of both t o identify the type of equipment under consideration. \u2022\u2022 A brief explanation on the main uses or applications of the equipment in the laboratory. \u2022\u2022 A basic description of the principles by which the equipment operates with explanations of principles or physical and\/or \nchemical la ws which the interested reader can \u2013 or should study in depth. \u2022\u2022 Installation requirements with emphasis on the electrical aspects and the r equirements for safe installation and operation, \nincluding worldwide electrical standards. \u2022\u2022 Basic routine maintenance, classifi  ed according to the required frequency (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually \nor sporadically). The procedures are numbered and presented in the actual sequence in which these should take place (model-specifi  c procedures can be found in the manuals published by the manufacturers). \u2022\u2022 Troubleshooting tables with the most frequent problems aff  ecting the equipment with possible causes and actions that \nmay resolve these problems. \u2022\u2022 A list of basic defi  nitions of some of the specialized terms used.","2. A stable work table located away from equipment \nthat generates vibrations, (centrifuges, and agitators). It must be of a suitable size to locate the necessary complementary equipment: reader, incubator, distributor and computer with its peripheral attachments at the side of the microplate washer. 3. An electric outlet in good condition with a ground pole \nand, an electrical connection which complies with the \ncountry\u2019s or the laboratory\u2019s norms and standards. In the \ncountries of the Americas, the 110 V and 60 Hz frequency \nis generally used. In other parts of the World, the 220-240 \nV and 50\/60 Hz frequency is generally used. ROUTINE MAINTENANCE \nThe routine maintenance described next focuses exclusively on the micr oplate washer. Maintenance of the microplate \nreader is dealt with in the Chapter 1. Basic maintenance \nFrequency: Daily 1. Verify the volume distributed. 2. Test the fi  lling uniformity. 3. Verify the aspiration sub-system\u2019s effi   ciency. 4. Confirm the cleaning of the supply and extraction \nneedles. 5. Clean the washer with distilled water after use, to remove \nevery vestige of salt in the supply and extraction sub-systems\u2019 channels. The needles may be kept submerged in distilled water. 6. Verify that the body of the washer has been cleaned. If necessary, clean the exterior surfaces with a piece of cloth, moistened with a mild detergent. 1 Procedure developed by PANBIO, ELISA Check Plus , Cat. N\u00ba E-ECP01T.

However, the specific mention of not protecting the sample indicates that while there is some level of protection, it does not extend to the sample itself.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can conclude that Class II Type A does not protect the sample.\n\n<ANSWER>: No, Class II Type A does not protect the sample.","instruction":"<DOCUMENT>Information on the compatibility of the rotor with other \nmodels of centrifuges from the same manufacturer. Recently manufactured centrifuges have incorporated \nnumerous improvements into their design to provide greater safety and longer operational life. Among advances mentioned are controls based on microprocessors. By means of software  controlled by a keyboard, these have several \ndiff erent operational programs in memory. According to the \ntype of rotor being used and procedure conducted, these programs control the centrifugation time, the required temperature, the rotor\u2019s revolutions, the acceleration and deceleration, alarms warning the operator about any anomaly during operation. Manufacturers have also incorporated induction motors \n(without brushes) in centrifuges. These have the advantage of electronically controlling currents and magnetic fields regulating the rotor\u2019s speed which reduces the frequency of maintenance. Operation and maintenance of such equipment must be carried out according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS\nCentrifuges require the following for normal operation:1. An electrical connection with a capacity suitable for the \nequipment providing stable single phase or triphase type voltage (depending on the model and specifi  cation \ngiven by the manufacturer).

Its purpose is to give a better \nunderstanding of the technical requirements regarding installation, use and maintenance of various types of equipment which play an important role in performing diagnostic testing. The manual also aims to provide support to personnel responsible for technical management, implementation of quality management and maintenance. Due to the diversity of origins, brands and models, this manual off  ers general recommendations. Equipment-specifi  c details \nare explained in depth in the maintenance and installation user manuals from manufacturers. These should be requested and ordered through the procurement processes of the individual agencies and professionals responsible for the acquisition of technology, or directly from the manufacturer. This manual was originally developed by the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) to support improved quality \nprogrammes which PAHO promotes in regional laboratories. The English version was produced by WHO to further expand support for quality programmes in other regions. The revised edition now includes 20 equipment groups selected to cover those most commonly used in low to medium technical complexity laboratories across the world. Given the diff  erences in \ntechnical complexity, brands and existing models, each chapter has been developed with basic equipment in mind, including new technology where relevant. The following information is included in each chapter: \n\u2022\u2022 Groups of equipment, organized by their generic names. Alternative names have also been included. \u2022\u2022 Photographs or diagrams, or a combination of both t o identify the type of equipment under consideration. \u2022\u2022 A brief explanation on the main uses or applications of the equipment in the laboratory. \u2022\u2022 A basic description of the principles by which the equipment operates with explanations of principles or physical and\/or \nchemical la ws which the interested reader can \u2013 or should study in depth. \u2022\u2022 Installation requirements with emphasis on the electrical aspects and the r equirements for safe installation and operation, \nincluding worldwide electrical standards. \u2022\u2022 Basic routine maintenance, classifi  ed according to the required frequency (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually \nor sporadically).

The \ncentrifuge is designed to use the centrifugal force generated in rotational movements to separate the constitutive elements of a mixture. There is a wide range of centrifuges capable of serving specifi  c industry and research needs. This \nchapter focuses on standing centrifuges normally used in public health and clinical laboratories. PHOTOGRAPH OF CENTRIFUGEPURPOSE OF THE CENTRIFUGE\nThe centrifuge uses centrifugal force (the force generated \nwhen an objec t rotates around a single point), for separating \nsolids suspended in a liquid by sedimentation, or liquids of diverse density. The rotational movements allow forces much greater than gravity to be generated in controlled periods of time. In the laboratory, centrifuges are generally used in processes such as the separation of solid components from biological liquids through sedimentation and in particular of blood components: red cells, white cells, platelets among others and for conducting multiple tests and treatments.There are several kinds of centrifuges. The most widely used in public health, surveillance and clinical laboratories are the table-top centrifuge, the ultracentrifuge, the haeamatocrit centrifuge and the standing centrifuge. OPERATION PRINCIPLES \nCentrifuges represent a practical application of Newton\u2019s law of motion. When a body of mass [m] turns around \na central point [O], it is subjected to a centripetal  force \n[N] directed towards the rotation axis with a magnitude N = m\u03c9\n2R, where [m] is the mass of the body, [R] is the radius \nand \u03c9 is the angular speed. Centrifuges possess a rotating axis on which is mounted a rotor with sample receiving compartments. Tangential speed is defi  ned by the following \nequation: VT=\u03c9R. Photo courtesy of Beckman CoulterCHAPTER 7  CENTRIFUGE\n46When the system spins at a speed of \u03c9 radians per second, \nthe samples are subjected to the centrifugal force Fp of the \nsame magnitude as N, but in an opposite direction. The \nfi gure shown below1 features a diagram of the concept, \nof its actual application and of the obtained result. This Fp force acts on particles in the substance centrifuged, \ncausing them to separate as a result of diff  erences in density. Denser particles will settle at the bottom of the tube in shorter periods of time, while lighter ones require longer periods of time, settling onto those of greater density. The relationship between the centrifugal acceleration [\u03c9\n2r ] to a \ngiven radius [r] and the force of gravity [g] is known as the relative centrifugal fi  eld or [RCF]\n2. RCF =r\u03c92\ng\nThe RCF is the tool which allows rotors of different \nspecifi  cations to be compared when equivalent centrifugal \neff ects are required. COMPONENTS OF THE CENTRIFUGE \nThe most important components of a centrifuge are the \nfollowing3:\nThe electric\/electronic control which generally has the following elements:1. On and off control, operation time control (timer), \nrotation speed control (in some centrifuges), temperature control (in refrigerated centrifuges), vibration control (safety mechanism) and brake system.2. Refrigeration system (in refrigerated centrifuges). 3. Vacuum system (in ultracentrifuges, not shown in the \nfi gure). 4.","This is explained in each manufacturer\u2019s test instruction manual. 3 If the bottom is fl  at, the suction needle is located very close to one of well\u2019s \nfaces; if it is rounded or V-shaped, the suction needle is centered.

The most widely used in public health, surveillance and clinical laboratories are the table-top centrifuge, the ultracentrifuge, the haeamatocrit centrifuge and the standing centrifuge. OPERATION PRINCIPLES \nCentrifuges represent a practical application of Newton\u2019s law of motion. When a body of mass [m] turns around \na central point [O], it is subjected to a centripetal  force \n[N] directed towards the rotation axis with a magnitude N = m\u03c9\n2R, where [m] is the mass of the body, [R] is the radius \nand \u03c9 is the angular speed. Centrifuges possess a rotating axis on which is mounted a rotor with sample receiving compartments. Tangential speed is defi  ned by the following \nequation: VT=\u03c9R. Photo courtesy of Beckman CoulterCHAPTER 7  CENTRIFUGE\n46When the system spins at a speed of \u03c9 radians per second, \nthe samples are subjected to the centrifugal force Fp of the \nsame magnitude as N, but in an opposite direction. The \nfi gure shown below1 features a diagram of the concept, \nof its actual application and of the obtained result. This Fp force acts on particles in the substance centrifuged, \ncausing them to separate as a result of diff  erences in density. Denser particles will settle at the bottom of the tube in shorter periods of time, while lighter ones require longer periods of time, settling onto those of greater density. The relationship between the centrifugal acceleration [\u03c9\n2r ] to a \ngiven radius [r] and the force of gravity [g] is known as the relative centrifugal fi  eld or [RCF]\n2. RCF =r\u03c92\ng\nThe RCF is the tool which allows rotors of different \nspecifi  cations to be compared when equivalent centrifugal \neff ects are required. COMPONENTS OF THE CENTRIFUGE \nThe most important components of a centrifuge are the \nfollowing3:\nThe electric\/electronic control which generally has the following elements:1. On and off control, operation time control (timer), \nrotation speed control (in some centrifuges), temperature control (in refrigerated centrifuges), vibration control (safety mechanism) and brake system.2. Refrigeration system (in refrigerated centrifuges). 3. Vacuum system (in ultracentrifuges, not shown in the \nfi gure). 4.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>This is explained in each manufacturer\u2019s test instruction manual. 3 If the bottom is fl  at, the suction needle is located very close to one of well\u2019s \nfaces; if it is rounded or V-shaped, the suction needle is centered.

Rinse the detector electrode abundantly with distilled \nwater. 3. Remove the upper cover of the detector electrode. 4. Fill the conduit surrounding the internal electrode with \na saturated potassium chloride (KCI) solution. Use the syringe or applicator supplied with the KCI solution. Verify that the tip of the syringe does not touch the inside of the electrode. 5. Close the electrode with its cover. Rinse the electrode \nin distilled water. 6. Keep the electrode in storage buff  er solution while not \nin use. Cleaning of the electrode\nThe type of cleaning required for electrodes depends of the t ype of contaminant aff  ecting it. The most common \nprocedures are summarized next:1.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Disadvantage: Does not protect the sample \nmanipulated in the cabinet. CLASS II \u2014 TYPE A\n1.

This light indicator fades when the \nweighing result becomes stable and is ready to be read. Alternatively in other balance models, this feature allows the display of the result on the screen when the measure of the weight becomes stable. 5. Electronic signalling process. It allows the processing \nand display of the weighing operation results. It may also allow other special functions such as piece counting, percentage weighing, dynamic weighing of unstable weight (e.g. animals), and formula weighing, among others. The calculations are done by the microprocessor following the instructions entered by the operator on the balance\u2019s keyboard. Classi\ufb01 cation of balances\nThe International Organization of Legal Metrology (OIML) \nhas classifi  ed the balances into four groups:\n\u2022\u2022 Group I: special exactitude \n\u2022\u2022 Group II: high exactitude \n\u2022\u2022 Group III: medium exactitude \n\u2022\u2022 Group IV: ordinary exactitude \nThe graph in Figure 14 shows the above-mentioned \nclassifi  cation. In the metrological classifi  cation of electronic balances, only \ntwo parameters are of importance:1. The maximum load [Max.]2. The value of the digital division [d]\n1The number of the scale\u2019s divisions is calculated by means of the following formula. n=Max\ndd\nThe OIML accepts the following convention for laboratory \nbalances. 1.

From this diagram it is \nnecessary to point out the following:1.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>Low cost DC voltmeter. Permits readings in millivolts. The voltage read is 10 \ntimes that of the cell, allowing a resolution of 0.1 millivolts. The reading is done by using carbon\/quinhydrone \nelectrodes.Description of typical control circuit elements  \n* Diff  erent voltage specifi  cations are applicable in certain regions of the World. INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS\nThe pH meter works using electric current with the following \ncharac teristics. Power:  Single phase Voltage: 110 V or 220-230 V Frequencies; \n50-60Hz depending on the World region. There is also portable pH meters powered with batteries. GENERAL CALIBRATION PROCEDURE\npH analyzers must be calibrated before use to guarantee \nthe qualit y and accuracy of the readings following these \nprocedures:1. One point calibration. This is carried out for normal \nworking conditions and for normal use. It uses one known pH reference solution. 2. Two point calibration. This is done prior to performing \nvery precise measurements. It uses two known pH reference solutions. It is also done if the instrument is used sporadically and its maintenance is not carried out frequently.Description of the process\nFrequency: Daily1. Calibr ate the pH meter using one known pH solution \n(one point calibration). 1.1 Connect the equipment to an electrical outlet with \nsuitable voltage. 1.2 A djust the temperature selector to the \nenvironmental temperature. 1.3 Adjust the meter.1.4 Remove the electrodes from the storage container. The electrodes must always be stored in a suitable solution. Some can be maintained in distilled water, others must be kept in a diff  erent solution \nas their manufacturers recommend\n1. If for some \nreason, the electrode becomes dry, it is necessary to soak it for at least 24 hours before use. 1.5 R inse the electrode with distilled water in an empty \nbeaker. 1.6 Dry the electrode with material able to absorb \nresidual liquid on its surface, without impregnating the electrode. To avoid possible contamination, the electrodes must be rinsed between diff  erent \nsolutions. 1 Verify the type of buff  er solution recommended by the electrode \nmanufacturer.MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n172. Place electrodes in the calibration solution. 2.1 Submerge the electrode in the standardization \nsolution in such a manner that its lower extremity does not touch the bottom of the beaker. This decreases the risk of breaking the electrode. If the test requires that the solution be kept in motion using the magnetic agitator, special care must be taken so that the agitation rod does not hit the electrode as this could break it. Buff  er solution \nis used as a calibration solution, because its pH is known and therefore will still be maintained even if a little contamination occurs. In general, a solution of pH = 7 is used for this purpose\n1.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>2. Air velocity on entering the cabinet: 38 cm\/s. 3.

The technique \nis based on the detection of an antigen or antibodies captured on a solid surface using direct or secondary, labelled antibodies, producing a reaction whose product can be read by the spectrophotometer. The word ELISA is the acronym for \u201cEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay\u201d . This chapter covers the use of microplate readers for ELISA testing. For additional information on the instrument principles of operation and maintenance, consult Chapter 11 discussing the spectrophotometer. PHOTOGRAPH OF MICROPLATE READER\nPURPOSE OF THE MICROPLATE READER\nThe microplate reader is used for reading the results of ELISA \ntests. This technique has a direct application in immunology and serology. Among other applications it confi  rms the \npresence of antibodies or antigens of an infectious agent in an organism, antibodies from a vaccine or auto-antibodies, for example in rheumatoid arthritis.OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThe microplate reader is a specialized spectrophotometer. Unlike the c onventional spectrophotometer which facilitates \nreadings on a wide range of wavelengths, the microplate reader has filters or diffraction gratings that limit the wavelength range to that used in ELISA, generally between 400 to 750 nm (nanometres). Some readers operate in the ultraviolet range and carry out analyses between 340 to 700 nm. The optical system exploited by many manufacturers uses optic fi  bres to supply light to the microplate wells \ncontaining the samples. The light beam, passing through the sample has a diameter ranging between 1 to 3 mm. A detection system detects the light coming from the sample, amplifi  es the signal and determines the sample\u2019s \nabsorbance. A reading system converts it into data allowing the test result interpretation. Some microplate readers use double beam light systems. Test samples are located in specially designed plates with \na specifi  c number of wells where the procedure or test is \ncarried out. Plates of 8 columns by 12 rows with a total of 96 wells are common. There are also plates with a greater number of wells. For specialized applications, the current trend is to increase the number of wells (384-well plates) to reduce the amount of reagents and samples used and a greater throughput. The location of the optical sensors of the microplate reader varies depending on the manufacturers: these can be located above the sample plate, or directly underneath the plate\u2019s wells. Nowadays microplate readers have controls regulated by \nmicroprocessors; connection interfaces to information systems; quality and process control programs, which by means of a computer, allow complete test automation.Chapter 1\nMicroplate Reader\nGMDN Code 37036\nECRI Code 16-979\nDenomination Photometric micro-plate reader\nPhoto courtesy of BioRad Laboratories CHAPTER 1  MICROPLATE READER\n2Equipment required for ELISA testing\nIn order to perform the ELISA technique, the following \nequipment is r equired:  \n1.

Test the  zero mechanism. Place the controls on zero \nand free the balance. If the reading does not stay at zero, adjust the zero mechanism (a grooved screw located in a horizontal position near the fulcrum). To do this, it is necessary to block the balance and slightly adjust the mechanism. The process is to be continued until the zero adjusts correctly on the reading scale.3.

The balance \nshould indicate 100. If the scale displays less or more than 100, the sensitivity control must be adjusted. This requires locking the balance, opening the upper cover and turning the sensitivity screw: If the scale registers more than 100; turn the screw in a clockwise position.

The pressure decreases until it reaches the vapour pre ssure of the fl  uid. This produces diverse phenomena such as vaporization of gases dissolved in the liquid or, in the case of water, the formation o f vapour bubbles collapsing after an \ninfi  nitesimal time lapse, perforating the surfaces of conducts in the immediate vicinity. This occurs in dilutors when using la rge capacity syringes with elevated \npropulsion speed. Concentration. A quantity measurement of a chemical substance present in a solution. The concept is expressed as the quantity of a substance dissolved into a \nsolvent. Concentration is expressed in diverse forms; the most common are: molarity [M], molality [m], normality [N], percentag e rate of solute. Dilution. To reduce the concentration of a solution by adding other fl  uids. The fl  uid added is known as the diluent .

This \nchapter focuses on standing centrifuges normally used in public health and clinical laboratories. PHOTOGRAPH OF CENTRIFUGEPURPOSE OF THE CENTRIFUGE\nThe centrifuge uses centrifugal force (the force generated \nwhen an objec t rotates around a single point), for separating \nsolids suspended in a liquid by sedimentation, or liquids of diverse density. The rotational movements allow forces much greater than gravity to be generated in controlled periods of time. In the laboratory, centrifuges are generally used in processes such as the separation of solid components from biological liquids through sedimentation and in particular of blood components: red cells, white cells, platelets among others and for conducting multiple tests and treatments.There are several kinds of centrifuges. The most widely used in public health, surveillance and clinical laboratories are the table-top centrifuge, the ultracentrifuge, the haeamatocrit centrifuge and the standing centrifuge.

The results obtained must be analyzed to determine if these are within the acceptable tolerances. The standard weights must be selected based on the balance\u2019s capacity. The above table complements the previous. It provides guidance in determining the standard weights to use in the calibration of a balance according to its capacity. ROUTINE MAINTENANCE\nThe balance is characterized as an instrument of high precision. For this reason, the operator is only responsible \nfor minimal maintenance limited to the following:\nDaily Activities\n1. Clean the weighing plate so that it is kept free of dust. Cleaning is done b y using a piece of clean cloth which \nmay be dampened with distilled water. If there is a stain, a mild detergent can be applied. Also a paintbrush with soft bristles can be used to remove particles or dust deposited on the weight plate. 2. Clean the weighing chamber, externally and internally. Verify that the glass is free from dust. 3. Verify that the adjustment mechanisms on the front \ndoor of the weighing chamber works adequately.4. Always use a clean, pre-weighed container for weighing \n(glass container or weighing paper if possible). Note that plastic can become electromagnetically charged and is not recommended for weighing powdered or granulated chemicals. 5.","5. Examine the exactitude of the time controls. Use a timer. The time measured must not vary by more than \u00b1 10 % of the programmed time.CHAPTER 7  CENTRIFUGE\n506. Verify the actual rotation speed against the selected \none using a normal load. The testing is done with a tachometer or a photo tachometer. If the hatch is not transparent, the procedure indicated by the manufacturer must be followed. 7. Confi  rm the functioning of the brake system. 8. Verify the functioning of the refrigeration system in \nrefrigerated centrifuges. The following are the most important activities:\na) Check the selected temperatures. These should \nnot vary by more than 3 \u00b0C from the temperatures measured on the digital thermometer. b) Verify the state of the air intake filter. If the \nfi  lter is obstructed, clean or substitute with an equivalent. c) Conduct a detailed cleaning of the diff  using wing of \nthe condenser to eliminate the fi  lth deposited. This \nmaintains the heat transference rate according to the design specifi  cations.","The cabinet must be certifi  ed annually to verify that it \ncomplies with the established requirements in the NSF 49 Regulation. USE OF THE SAFETY CABINET\nCorrect utilization of the biological safety cabinet is achieved by complying with the following instructions:\n1.
