The mobile parts (weighing plate, support \ncolumn [a], bobbin, position and load indicator [G] -the object in the process of being weighed-) are maintained in equilibrium by a compensation force [F] equal to the weight. The compensation force is generated by an electrical current through a bobbin in the air gap of a cylindrical electromagnet. The force F is calculated with the equation [F = I x L x B] where: I = electrical intensity, L = total length of the wire of the coil and B = magnetic fl  ow intensity in the \nelectromagnet\u2019s air gap.With any change in the load (weight\/mass), the mobile \nmechanical system responds by moving vertically a fraction of distance. Detected by a photosensor [e], an electrical signal is sent to the servo-amplifi  er [f]. This changes the \nfl ow of electrical current passing through the bobbin of the \nmagnet [c] in such a manner that the mobile system returns to the balanced position upon adjusting of the magnetic fl ow in the electromagnet. Consequently, the weight of \nthe mass [G] can be measured indirectly at the start of the electrical current fl  ow, which passes through the circuit \nmeasuring the voltage [V] by means of a precision resistor [R], [V = I x R]. To date, many systems developed use the electronic system for carrying out very exact measurements of mass and weight. The following diagram explains how electronic balances function.

The reference electrode is usually made of the same type of material as the internal electrode. Both tubes, interior and exterior, contain a reference solution. Only the outer tube has contact with the measured solution through a porous cap which acts as a saline bridge. This device acts like a galvanized cell. The reference electrode \nis the internal tube of the pH meter probe, which cannot lose ions through interactions with the surrounding environment. Therefore as a reference, it remains static (unchangeable) during the measuring process. The external tube of the probe contains the medium which is allowed  to mix with the external environment. As a result, this tube must be fi lled periodically with a potassium chloride solution (KCI) \nfor restoring the capacity of the electrode which would otherwise be inhibited by a loss of ions and evaporation.

The body of the instrument containing the circuits, \ncontrols, connectors, display screens and measuring scales. The following are among some of its most \nimportant components:\na) An ON and OFF switch. Not all pH meters have an \non and off   switch. Some simply have a cord with a \nplug which allows it to be connected to a suitable electrical outlet. b) Temperature control. This control allows \nadjustments according to the temperature of the solution measured. c) Calibration controls. Depending on the design, \npH meters possess one or two calibration buttons or dials. Normally these are identifi  ed by Cal 1  and \nCal 2 . If the pH meter is calibrated using only one \nsolution, the Cal 1 button is used; making sure that Cal 2 is set at a 100%. If the pH meter allows  two point calibrations, two known pH solutions covering the range of pH to be measured are used. In this case, the two controls are used (Cal 1 and Cal 2). In special cases, a three-point calibration must be done (using three known pH solutions). d) Mode selector.","Remove the cover of the boiling tank.3.

The \ncentrifuge is designed to use the centrifugal force generated in rotational movements to separate the constitutive elements of a mixture. There is a wide range of centrifuges capable of serving specifi  c industry and research needs. This \nchapter focuses on standing centrifuges normally used in public health and clinical laboratories. PHOTOGRAPH OF CENTRIFUGEPURPOSE OF THE CENTRIFUGE\nThe centrifuge uses centrifugal force (the force generated \nwhen an objec t rotates around a single point), for separating \nsolids suspended in a liquid by sedimentation, or liquids of diverse density. The rotational movements allow forces much greater than gravity to be generated in controlled periods of time. In the laboratory, centrifuges are generally used in processes such as the separation of solid components from biological liquids through sedimentation and in particular of blood components: red cells, white cells, platelets among others and for conducting multiple tests and treatments.There are several kinds of centrifuges. The most widely used in public health, surveillance and clinical laboratories are the table-top centrifuge, the ultracentrifuge, the haeamatocrit centrifuge and the standing centrifuge.

The \ncentrifuge is designed to use the centrifugal force generated in rotational movements to separate the constitutive elements of a mixture. There is a wide range of centrifuges capable of serving specifi  c industry and research needs. This \nchapter focuses on standing centrifuges normally used in public health and clinical laboratories. PHOTOGRAPH OF CENTRIFUGEPURPOSE OF THE CENTRIFUGE\nThe centrifuge uses centrifugal force (the force generated \nwhen an objec t rotates around a single point), for separating \nsolids suspended in a liquid by sedimentation, or liquids of diverse density. The rotational movements allow forces much greater than gravity to be generated in controlled periods of time. In the laboratory, centrifuges are generally used in processes such as the separation of solid components from biological liquids through sedimentation and in particular of blood components: red cells, white cells, platelets among others and for conducting multiple tests and treatments.There are several kinds of centrifuges. The most widely used in public health, surveillance and clinical laboratories are the table-top centrifuge, the ultracentrifuge, the haeamatocrit centrifuge and the standing centrifuge. OPERATION PRINCIPLES \nCentrifuges represent a practical application of Newton\u2019s law of motion. When a body of mass [m] turns around \na central point [O], it is subjected to a centripetal  force \n[N] directed towards the rotation axis with a magnitude N = m\u03c9\n2R, where [m] is the mass of the body, [R] is the radius \nand \u03c9 is the angular speed.

In the laboratory, the balance is used \nfor weighing as part of quality control activities (on devices like pipettes), in the preparation of mixtures of components in predefined proportions and in the determination of specifi  c densities or weights. OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThere are diff  erences in design, principles and criteria of \nmetrology amongst balances. At present, there are two large groups of balances: mechanical and electronic balances. Mechanical balances \nThe following are some of the more common ones: 1. Spring balance. Its function is based on a mechanical \nproperty of springs as the force exercised on a spring is proportional to the spring\u2019s elasticity constant [k], multiplied by its elongation [x] [F = -kx]. The greater the mass [m] placed on the balance\u2019s plate, the greater the elongation will be, given that the elongation is proportional to the mass and the spring\u2019s constant. The calibration of a spring balance depends on the force of gravity acting on the object weighed. This type of balance is used when great precision is not necessary. 2. Sliding weight balance. This type of balance is \nequipped with two known weights which can be moved on setting scales (one macro, the other micro). Upon placing a substance of unknown mass on the tray, its weight is determined by moving the weight on both setting scales until the equilibrium position is reached. At this point, the weight is obtained by adding both quantities indicated by the sliding masses\u2019 position on the scale. 3. Analytical balance. This balance functions by comparing \nknown weight masses with that of a substance of unknown weight. It is composed of a base on a bar or symmetrical lever, maintained by a blade-like support on a central point called a fulcrum. At its ends, there are stirrups, also supported with blades which allow these to oscillate smoothly. From there, two plates are suspended. Certifi  ed weights are placed on one \nof the plates and unknown weights on the other. The balance has a securing system or lock, which allows the main lever to remain stable when not in use or when it is necessary to modify the counter-weights. The balance is inside an external box which protects it from interferences, such as air currents. Analytical balances can weigh ten thousandths of a gram (0.0001 g) or 100 thousandths of a gram (0.00001 g). This type of balance generally has a capacity of up to 200 grams.

This type of balance has a loading plate located \non its upper part, supported by a column maintained in a vertical position by two pairs of guides with fl  exible \nconnections.

The requirement with this type of mechanism is that parallel guides must be maintained with exactitude of up to \u00b1 1  \u00b5m.

The water distiller, also called distillation unit or water still, used in the laboratory, purifi  es running water by means of controlled \nvaporization and cooling processes. Upon applying thermal energy to water in a liquid phase by a warming process, it is changed into vapour. This allows the water molecules to separate from the molecules of other substances mixed or diluted. The water vapour is collected and passed through a condenser, where it is cooled and returned to the liquid phase. Then, the condensed water is collected into a diff  erent storage tank. Distilled water shows pure \ncharacteristics compared to running water; it is practically free of contaminating substances.PURPOSE OF THE WATER DISTILLER\nThe water distiller facilitates obtaining very pure water from potable wat er normally provided by the aqueduct services \nin urban centres. Distilled water is characterized by a lack of solids in suspension. It is used in multiple applications in centres which provide health services, especially in laboratory units, in washing, sterilization and dietetics. The more specialized the procedures are in the laboratory, the greater will be the level of purity required. For example: the preparation of reagents or biological material requires water of the highest quality. Distillation is one of the fundamental processes to achieve this (although it may not be the only one required).

There is a wide range of centrifuges capable of serving specifi  c industry and research needs. This \nchapter focuses on standing centrifuges normally used in public health and clinical laboratories. PHOTOGRAPH OF CENTRIFUGEPURPOSE OF THE CENTRIFUGE\nThe centrifuge uses centrifugal force (the force generated \nwhen an objec t rotates around a single point), for separating \nsolids suspended in a liquid by sedimentation, or liquids of diverse density. The rotational movements allow forces much greater than gravity to be generated in controlled periods of time. In the laboratory, centrifuges are generally used in processes such as the separation of solid components from biological liquids through sedimentation and in particular of blood components: red cells, white cells, platelets among others and for conducting multiple tests and treatments.There are several kinds of centrifuges. The most widely used in public health, surveillance and clinical laboratories are the table-top centrifuge, the ultracentrifuge, the haeamatocrit centrifuge and the standing centrifuge. OPERATION PRINCIPLES \nCentrifuges represent a practical application of Newton\u2019s law of motion. When a body of mass [m] turns around \na central point [O], it is subjected to a centripetal  force \n[N] directed towards the rotation axis with a magnitude N = m\u03c9\n2R, where [m] is the mass of the body, [R] is the radius \nand \u03c9 is the angular speed. Centrifuges possess a rotating axis on which is mounted a rotor with sample receiving compartments. Tangential speed is defi  ned by the following \nequation: VT=\u03c9R.

This Fp force acts on particles in the substance centrifuged, \ncausing them to separate as a result of diff  erences in density. Denser particles will settle at the bottom of the tube in shorter periods of time, while lighter ones require longer periods of time, settling onto those of greater density. The relationship between the centrifugal acceleration [\u03c9\n2r ] to a \ngiven radius [r] and the force of gravity [g] is known as the relative centrifugal fi  eld or [RCF]\n2.

Extraction is done by a set of needles mounted on the washer\/dryer\u2019s head. The number of needles varies from one to three, according to the washer model used. If it uses only one needle, the washing and \nextraction operation is done with this single needle. If it uses two needles, one is used for supplying the washing solution and the other for extraction. If it uses three needles, the fi  rst is used for supplying the washing \nsolution, the second for extraction and the third for controlling (extracting) any excess volume in the well. Generally, the extraction needle is longer than the supply needle, which enables it to advance (vertically) up to a height ranging between 0.3 and 0.5 mm from the bottom of the well. \u2022\u2022 Advance sub-system. This is composed of a \nmechanism which moves the supply and extraction head horizontally to reach each well in the ELISA plate. When the horizontal movement to the following row occurs, there is a vertical movement towards the well to dispense or extract the washing solution. There are washers which carry out these operations in a simultaneous manner.The sub-systems previously described are shown in Figure \n2. Figure 3 shows the diff  erent types of wells most commonly \nfound in microplates. Each kind of well is suitable for a particular type of test. Washing process\nThe washing of the microplate is one of the stages of the ELISA t echnique. Special solutions are used in the washing \nsteps. Among those most commonly used is phosphate buff er solution or PBS. The phosphate buff  er solution has a \nstability of 2 months if kept at 4 \u00b0C. It is estimated that 1 to 3 litres of solution is required for washing one microplate and that 300 \u00b5l is used in each well per cycle. Washing can \nbe done manually, but it is preferable to use an automated microplate washer for a better throughput and to minimize handling of potentially contaminated substances. Among the washing processes used by microplate washers \nare featured:\n\u2022\u2022 Aspir ation from top to bottom. When the aspiration \nphase is initiated, the needles move vertically and the aspiration is initiated immediately as these enter into the liquid. The process continues until the needles reach their lowest position very close to the bottom of the wells. At this point they are stopped in order to avoid suctioning the air that should fl  ow against the \ninterior lateral walls of the wells. This type of aspiration prevents air currents from drying the bound protein on the surface of the wells.

In certain \ntypes of washer, the washing and aspiration systems operate simultaneously, generating a controlled turbulence inside the well which removes the unbound substances during the incubations. \u2022\u2022 Aspir ation from the base of the wells. In this system, \nthe aspiration of the fluid contained in the wells is performed initially with the aspiration needles in a position very close to the bottom, immediately beginning a suctioning cycle, usually time-controlled. This system may aspirate air if there are diff  erences in \nthe levels of the tanks. Washer calibration\nThe microplate washer is critical for guaranteeing that the ELISA t echnique performs as expected. The alignment to \nbe taken into account for the eff  ective functioning of the \nequipment is presented next:\n\u2022\u2022 Position of the needles (supply and aspiration head). The horizontal and vertical position adjustment with respect to the wells must be verifi  ed carefully. If the \nplate has fl  at bottom wells, the supply needle must be \nchecked to see that it is situated very close to the well\u2019s wall. If the bottom is round or V-shaped, the suction needle should be located in the centre of the well: upon the vertical movement, a needle-base distance is maintained in the well, usually between 0.3 to 0.5 mm. The needles must never be allowed to touch the bottom of the wells to avoid mechanical interferences between the needle point and the well\u2019s base during the aspiration function. \u2022\u2022 Aspir ation time. Appropriately adjust the aspiration \ntime so that a solution fi  lm adhered to the well\u2019s wall \ncan fl  ow towards the bottom. Avoid very long time lapses to prevent the coating on the wells from drying up. Check that the suction system\u2019s needles are clean (free of obstructions). \u2022\u2022 Distributed V olume. Check that the volume distributed \nis as close as possible to the maximum capacity of the well; confi  rm that all the wells are fi  lled uniformly (at \nthe same level). Verify that the distributing needles are clean (free of obstructions). \u2022\u2022 Vacuum. The suctioning system must be calibrated \neffi  ciently. If the vacuum is too strong, the test can \nbe altered. In fact, it could dry out the wells and considerably weaken the enzyme activity in the wells and completely alter the test result. The majority of washers function with a vacuum ranging between 60 and 70% of atmospheric pressure. In some washers, the vacuum is made in an external pump which operates as an accessory of the washer. Its operation is controlled by the washer, which means that the vacuum pump operates only when required. Washing process veri\ufb01  cation \nTo verify that the washing process is done according to \nthe specifications of ELISA t echniques, manufacturers \nof ELISA tests have developed procedures to be carried out regularly. One of the controls\n1 is based on using the \nperoxidase reagent, which is dispensed using a pipette in the plate wells to be read at 405, 450 and 492 nm. At once the wells are washed and a colourless substrate is added (TMB\/H\n2O2\u2013Tetramethylbenzidine\/Hydrogen Peroxide). Whatever conjugate remains will hydrolyze the enzyme and the chromogen will change to blue. After stopping the reaction with acid, the TMB will turn yellow again. The resulting colour intensity is directly related to the washing process effi   ciency. INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS\nFor the microplate washer to operate correctly, the following \nis nec essary: \n1.

Substitution Balance (Unequal-lever arm or two-\nknife balance). This is a balance with a single plate. An unknown mass is placed on the weighing plate.

The fulcrum is generally off  -centre in relation to the length of the load \nbeam and located near the front of the balance.

The mobile parts (weighing plate, support \ncolumn [a], bobbin, position and load indicator [G] -the object in the process of being weighed-) are maintained in equilibrium by a compensation force [F] equal to the weight. The compensation force is generated by an electrical current through a bobbin in the air gap of a cylindrical electromagnet.

Detected by a photosensor [e], an electrical signal is sent to the servo-amplifi  er [f]. This changes the \nfl ow of electrical current passing through the bobbin of the \nmagnet [c] in such a manner that the mobile system returns to the balanced position upon adjusting of the magnetic fl ow in the electromagnet.

The \ncentrifuge is designed to use the centrifugal force generated in rotational movements to separate the constitutive elements of a mixture. There is a wide range of centrifuges capable of serving specifi  c industry and research needs. This \nchapter focuses on standing centrifuges normally used in public health and clinical laboratories. PHOTOGRAPH OF CENTRIFUGEPURPOSE OF THE CENTRIFUGE\nThe centrifuge uses centrifugal force (the force generated \nwhen an objec t rotates around a single point), for separating \nsolids suspended in a liquid by sedimentation, or liquids of diverse density. The rotational movements allow forces much greater than gravity to be generated in controlled periods of time. In the laboratory, centrifuges are generally used in processes such as the separation of solid components from biological liquids through sedimentation and in particular of blood components: red cells, white cells, platelets among others and for conducting multiple tests and treatments.There are several kinds of centrifuges. The most widely used in public health, surveillance and clinical laboratories are the table-top centrifuge, the ultracentrifuge, the haeamatocrit centrifuge and the standing centrifuge. OPERATION PRINCIPLES \nCentrifuges represent a practical application of Newton\u2019s law of motion. When a body of mass [m] turns around \na central point [O], it is subjected to a centripetal  force \n[N] directed towards the rotation axis with a magnitude N = m\u03c9\n2R, where [m] is the mass of the body, [R] is the radius \nand \u03c9 is the angular speed. Centrifuges possess a rotating axis on which is mounted a rotor with sample receiving compartments. Tangential speed is defi  ned by the following \nequation: VT=\u03c9R. Photo courtesy of Beckman CoulterCHAPTER 7  CENTRIFUGE\n46When the system spins at a speed of \u03c9 radians per second, \nthe samples are subjected to the centrifugal force Fp of the \nsame magnitude as N, but in an opposite direction. The \nfi gure shown below1 features a diagram of the concept, \nof its actual application and of the obtained result. This Fp force acts on particles in the substance centrifuged, \ncausing them to separate as a result of diff  erences in density. Denser particles will settle at the bottom of the tube in shorter periods of time, while lighter ones require longer periods of time, settling onto those of greater density. The relationship between the centrifugal acceleration [\u03c9\n2r ] to a \ngiven radius [r] and the force of gravity [g] is known as the relative centrifugal fi  eld or [RCF]\n2. RCF =r\u03c92\ng\nThe RCF is the tool which allows rotors of different \nspecifi  cations to be compared when equivalent centrifugal \neff ects are required.

Identify the role of electrical resistors in the context of a water bath.\n2. Look for specific details in the provided context that explain how these resistors function.\n3. Summarize the findings in a clear and concise manner.\n\nFrom the context, I can see that electrical resistors are crucial for heating the medium (water or oil) in the water bath. The context states that \"By means of these, heat is transferred to the medium (water or oil) until reaching the temperature selected with a control device (thermostat or similar).\" This indicates that the resistors are responsible for generating heat.\n\nAdditionally, the context describes two types of resistors: immersion type and external type. The immersion type is \"installed inside a sealed tube and located on the lower part of the container in direct contact with heating medium,\" while the external type \"transfers the heat to the bottom of the tank through thermal conduction.\"\n\nThus, the purpose of electrical resistors in a water bath is to generate and transfer heat to the liquid medium, allowing for precise temperature control.\n\nFinal answer: <ANSWER>: The purpose of electrical resistors in a water bath is to generate and transfer heat to the medium (water or oil) to maintain a selected temperature.","instruction":"<DOCUMENT>Specifi  es the type of rotor for which the \ntechnical information is being provided. 2.

The control panel has these elements:\n1. The on and off   control switch\n2. A Menu button for selecting the operation\u2019s parameters: \noperation temperature, alarm temperature, temperature scale (\u00b0C, \u00b0F)\n3. Two buttons for parameter adjustment4. A screen 5. A pilot light6. Pilots (2) for identifying the temperature scale (\u00b0C, \u00b0F). WATER BATH OPERATION\nInstallation\n1. Install the water bath close to an electrical outlet. The \noutlet must ha ve its respective ground pole in order \nto guarantee the protection and safety of the operator and the equipment. Water baths generally operate at 120 V\/60 Hz or 230 V\/60Hz. Its installation and use is facilitated by a sink close by for supplying and draining of water. 2. Verify that the location selected is levelled and has the \nnecessary resistance to safely support the weight of the water bath when it is full of liquid. 3. Ensure that the location has a suitable amount of space \nfor putting the samples and the accessories required for the normal operation of the water bath. 4. Avoid placing the water bath where there are strong air \ncurrents which can interfere with its normal operation. For example: in front of an air-conditioning unit or window. Safety\n1. Avoid the use of the water bath in environments where \nther e are fl  ammable and combustible materials. The \nequipment has components (resistors generating very high temperatures) which could start an accidental fi  re \nor explosion. 2. Always connect the equipment to an electrical outlet \nwith a ground pole to protect the user and the equipment from electrical discharges. The electrical connection must comply with the required norms of the country and the laboratory. 3. Use the water bath exclusively with non-corrosive or \nnon-fl  ammable liquids. 4. Use personal protective elements when working with \nthe water bath. The bath has resistors which can cause burns if inadvertently touched, even a considerable time after turning off   the equipment. 5. When working with substances that generate vapours, \nplace the water bath under a chemical hood or in a well ventilated area. 6. Remember that liquids incubated in the water bath tank \ncan produce burns if hands are inadvertently placed inside it. 7. Take into account that the water bath is designed for \nuse with a liquid inside the tank. If the inside is dry, the temperature of the tank can become very high. Use the diff  using tray for placing the container inside of the \nfi lled tank of the water bath. This has been designed for \ndistributing the temperature in a uniform way. 8.

OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nWater baths are made of steel and are generally c overed with electrostatic paint \nwith high adherence and resistance to environmental laboratory conditions. Water baths have an external panel on which the controls can be found. They also have a tank made of rustproof material with a collection of electrical resistors mounted on their lower part. By means of these, heat is transferred to the medium (water or oil) until reaching the temperature selected with a control device (thermostat or similar). The resistors may be of the following types:\u2022 Immersion type. These resistors are installed inside \na sealed tube and located on the lower part of the container in direct contact with heating medium. \u2022\u2022 External.

The pressure decreases until it reaches the vapour pre ssure of the fl  uid. This produces diverse phenomena such as vaporization of gases dissolved in the liquid or, in the case of water, the formation o f vapour bubbles collapsing after an \ninfi  nitesimal time lapse, perforating the surfaces of conducts in the immediate vicinity. This occurs in dilutors when using la rge capacity syringes with elevated \npropulsion speed. Concentration. A quantity measurement of a chemical substance present in a solution. The concept is expressed as the quantity of a substance dissolved into a \nsolvent. Concentration is expressed in diverse forms; the most common are: molarity [M], molality [m], normality [N], percentag e rate of solute. Dilution. To reduce the concentration of a solution by adding other fl  uids. The fl  uid added is known as the diluent . Adding the molecules of a liquid substance with \nthe molecules of another liquid substance. In order to determine the volume V1 of liquid needed to obtain V2 volume at a concen tration C2 from a stock solution of \nconcentration C1, the following equation is used:  \nDispenser. A device used for distributing liquids.","Substitution balance CHAPTER 4  BALANCES\n244. Verify the plate\u2019s brake.

This generates an \nelectromotive force (EMF) which, according to the Nernst law is calculated using the following equation:\n \nGiven that: \npH=lnaHL where a is the eff  ective concentration of ions (Activity) \nIf n = 1, the equation is then rewritten as: \n  E=Eo\u2212R'T\nFpH\nE\u00b0 is a constant dependant on the temperature. If E\u00b0 is substituted by E\u2019T, the calibration will be more sensitive. Real electr odes \ndo not always perform according to the Nernst equation. If the concept of sensibility (s) is introduced, the equation can be rewritten as:\nE=E'T\u2212sR'T\nFpH\nThe values of E\u2019 and s are found when measuring the EMF in two solutions with known pH. S is the slope of E versus pH, \nwhile E\u2019 is found at the intersection with the axis y.

Its purpose is to give a better \nunderstanding of the technical requirements regarding installation, use and maintenance of various types of equipment which play an important role in performing diagnostic testing. The manual also aims to provide support to personnel responsible for technical management, implementation of quality management and maintenance. Due to the diversity of origins, brands and models, this manual off  ers general recommendations. Equipment-specifi  c details \nare explained in depth in the maintenance and installation user manuals from manufacturers. These should be requested and ordered through the procurement processes of the individual agencies and professionals responsible for the acquisition of technology, or directly from the manufacturer. This manual was originally developed by the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) to support improved quality \nprogrammes which PAHO promotes in regional laboratories. The English version was produced by WHO to further expand support for quality programmes in other regions. The revised edition now includes 20 equipment groups selected to cover those most commonly used in low to medium technical complexity laboratories across the world. Given the diff  erences in \ntechnical complexity, brands and existing models, each chapter has been developed with basic equipment in mind, including new technology where relevant. The following information is included in each chapter: \n\u2022\u2022 Groups of equipment, organized by their generic names. Alternative names have also been included. \u2022\u2022 Photographs or diagrams, or a combination of both t o identify the type of equipment under consideration. \u2022\u2022 A brief explanation on the main uses or applications of the equipment in the laboratory. \u2022\u2022 A basic description of the principles by which the equipment operates with explanations of principles or physical and\/or \nchemical la ws which the interested reader can \u2013 or should study in depth. \u2022\u2022 Installation requirements with emphasis on the electrical aspects and the r equirements for safe installation and operation, \nincluding worldwide electrical standards. \u2022\u2022 Basic routine maintenance, classifi  ed according to the required frequency (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually \nor sporadically). The procedures are numbered and presented in the actual sequence in which these should take place (model-specifi  c procedures can be found in the manuals published by the manufacturers). \u2022\u2022 Troubleshooting tables with the most frequent problems aff  ecting the equipment with possible causes and actions that \nmay resolve these problems. \u2022\u2022 A list of basic defi  nitions of some of the specialized terms used.","This is explained in each manufacturer\u2019s test instruction manual. 3 If the bottom is fl  at, the suction needle is located very close to one of well\u2019s \nfaces; if it is rounded or V-shaped, the suction needle is centered.

Register the reading obtained on the control sheet. 4.6 Turn the functions selector again to the Standby \nposition. If it is necessary to measure the pH of more than one solution, repeat the previously described procedures, rinsing the probe with distilled water and drying with clean, lint-free paper between readings. When the pH has to be measured in numerous solutions, the pH meter must be calibrated frequently, following the steps previously described. 5. Turn off the pH meter. 5.1 Remove the electrode from the last solution \nanalyzed. 5.2 R inse the electrode in distilled water and dry it with \na drying material that will not penetrate it. 5.3 Place the electrode in its storage container. 5.4 Verify that the functions selector is in the Standby \nposition. 5.5 Activate the off switch or disconnect the feed \ncable, if it lacks this control.","2.

Its purpose is to give a better \nunderstanding of the technical requirements regarding installation, use and maintenance of various types of equipment which play an important role in performing diagnostic testing. The manual also aims to provide support to personnel responsible for technical management, implementation of quality management and maintenance. Due to the diversity of origins, brands and models, this manual off  ers general recommendations. Equipment-specifi  c details \nare explained in depth in the maintenance and installation user manuals from manufacturers. These should be requested and ordered through the procurement processes of the individual agencies and professionals responsible for the acquisition of technology, or directly from the manufacturer. This manual was originally developed by the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) to support improved quality \nprogrammes which PAHO promotes in regional laboratories. The English version was produced by WHO to further expand support for quality programmes in other regions. The revised edition now includes 20 equipment groups selected to cover those most commonly used in low to medium technical complexity laboratories across the world. Given the diff  erences in \ntechnical complexity, brands and existing models, each chapter has been developed with basic equipment in mind, including new technology where relevant. The following information is included in each chapter: \n\u2022\u2022 Groups of equipment, organized by their generic names. Alternative names have also been included. \u2022\u2022 Photographs or diagrams, or a combination of both t o identify the type of equipment under consideration. \u2022\u2022 A brief explanation on the main uses or applications of the equipment in the laboratory. \u2022\u2022 A basic description of the principles by which the equipment operates with explanations of principles or physical and\/or \nchemical la ws which the interested reader can \u2013 or should study in depth. \u2022\u2022 Installation requirements with emphasis on the electrical aspects and the r equirements for safe installation and operation, \nincluding worldwide electrical standards. \u2022\u2022 Basic routine maintenance, classifi  ed according to the required frequency (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually \nor sporadically). The procedures are numbered and presented in the actual sequence in which these should take place (model-specifi  c procedures can be found in the manuals published by the manufacturers). \u2022\u2022 Troubleshooting tables with the most frequent problems aff  ecting the equipment with possible causes and actions that \nmay resolve these problems. \u2022\u2022 A list of basic defi  nitions of some of the specialized terms used.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>This is explained in each manufacturer\u2019s test instruction manual. 3 If the bottom is fl  at, the suction needle is located very close to one of well\u2019s \nfaces; if it is rounded or V-shaped, the suction needle is centered.

The \ncentrifuge is designed to use the centrifugal force generated in rotational movements to separate the constitutive elements of a mixture. There is a wide range of centrifuges capable of serving specifi  c industry and research needs. This \nchapter focuses on standing centrifuges normally used in public health and clinical laboratories. PHOTOGRAPH OF CENTRIFUGEPURPOSE OF THE CENTRIFUGE\nThe centrifuge uses centrifugal force (the force generated \nwhen an objec t rotates around a single point), for separating \nsolids suspended in a liquid by sedimentation, or liquids of diverse density. The rotational movements allow forces much greater than gravity to be generated in controlled periods of time. In the laboratory, centrifuges are generally used in processes such as the separation of solid components from biological liquids through sedimentation and in particular of blood components: red cells, white cells, platelets among others and for conducting multiple tests and treatments.There are several kinds of centrifuges. The most widely used in public health, surveillance and clinical laboratories are the table-top centrifuge, the ultracentrifuge, the haeamatocrit centrifuge and the standing centrifuge. OPERATION PRINCIPLES \nCentrifuges represent a practical application of Newton\u2019s law of motion. When a body of mass [m] turns around \na central point [O], it is subjected to a centripetal  force \n[N] directed towards the rotation axis with a magnitude N = m\u03c9\n2R, where [m] is the mass of the body, [R] is the radius \nand \u03c9 is the angular speed. Centrifuges possess a rotating axis on which is mounted a rotor with sample receiving compartments. Tangential speed is defi  ned by the following \nequation: VT=\u03c9R. Photo courtesy of Beckman CoulterCHAPTER 7  CENTRIFUGE\n46When the system spins at a speed of \u03c9 radians per second, \nthe samples are subjected to the centrifugal force Fp of the \nsame magnitude as N, but in an opposite direction. The \nfi gure shown below1 features a diagram of the concept, \nof its actual application and of the obtained result. This Fp force acts on particles in the substance centrifuged, \ncausing them to separate as a result of diff  erences in density. Denser particles will settle at the bottom of the tube in shorter periods of time, while lighter ones require longer periods of time, settling onto those of greater density. The relationship between the centrifugal acceleration [\u03c9\n2r ] to a \ngiven radius [r] and the force of gravity [g] is known as the relative centrifugal fi  eld or [RCF]\n2. RCF =r\u03c92\ng\nThe RCF is the tool which allows rotors of different \nspecifi  cations to be compared when equivalent centrifugal \neff ects are required. COMPONENTS OF THE CENTRIFUGE \nThe most important components of a centrifuge are the \nfollowing3:\nThe electric\/electronic control which generally has the following elements:1. On and off control, operation time control (timer), \nrotation speed control (in some centrifuges), temperature control (in refrigerated centrifuges), vibration control (safety mechanism) and brake system.2. Refrigeration system (in refrigerated centrifuges). 3. Vacuum system (in ultracentrifuges, not shown in the \nfi gure). 4.","2.

The \ncentrifuge is designed to use the centrifugal force generated in rotational movements to separate the constitutive elements of a mixture. There is a wide range of centrifuges capable of serving specifi  c industry and research needs. This \nchapter focuses on standing centrifuges normally used in public health and clinical laboratories. PHOTOGRAPH OF CENTRIFUGEPURPOSE OF THE CENTRIFUGE\nThe centrifuge uses centrifugal force (the force generated \nwhen an objec t rotates around a single point), for separating \nsolids suspended in a liquid by sedimentation, or liquids of diverse density. The rotational movements allow forces much greater than gravity to be generated in controlled periods of time. In the laboratory, centrifuges are generally used in processes such as the separation of solid components from biological liquids through sedimentation and in particular of blood components: red cells, white cells, platelets among others and for conducting multiple tests and treatments.There are several kinds of centrifuges. The most widely used in public health, surveillance and clinical laboratories are the table-top centrifuge, the ultracentrifuge, the haeamatocrit centrifuge and the standing centrifuge. OPERATION PRINCIPLES \nCentrifuges represent a practical application of Newton\u2019s law of motion. When a body of mass [m] turns around \na central point [O], it is subjected to a centripetal  force \n[N] directed towards the rotation axis with a magnitude N = m\u03c9\n2R, where [m] is the mass of the body, [R] is the radius \nand \u03c9 is the angular speed. Centrifuges possess a rotating axis on which is mounted a rotor with sample receiving compartments. Tangential speed is defi  ned by the following \nequation: VT=\u03c9R. Photo courtesy of Beckman CoulterCHAPTER 7  CENTRIFUGE\n46When the system spins at a speed of \u03c9 radians per second, \nthe samples are subjected to the centrifugal force Fp of the \nsame magnitude as N, but in an opposite direction. The \nfi gure shown below1 features a diagram of the concept, \nof its actual application and of the obtained result. This Fp force acts on particles in the substance centrifuged, \ncausing them to separate as a result of diff  erences in density. Denser particles will settle at the bottom of the tube in shorter periods of time, while lighter ones require longer periods of time, settling onto those of greater density. The relationship between the centrifugal acceleration [\u03c9\n2r ] to a \ngiven radius [r] and the force of gravity [g] is known as the relative centrifugal fi  eld or [RCF]\n2. RCF =r\u03c92\ng\nThe RCF is the tool which allows rotors of different \nspecifi  cations to be compared when equivalent centrifugal \neff ects are required. COMPONENTS OF THE CENTRIFUGE \nThe most important components of a centrifuge are the \nfollowing3:\nThe electric\/electronic control which generally has the following elements:1. On and off control, operation time control (timer), \nrotation speed control (in some centrifuges), temperature control (in refrigerated centrifuges), vibration control (safety mechanism) and brake system.2. Refrigeration system (in refrigerated centrifuges). 3. Vacuum system (in ultracentrifuges, not shown in the \nfi gure). 4.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>2.

A basic substance dissolved in water is capable of producing [OH\u2013] (hydroxides) ions. An acid substance has a greater quantity of ions [H+] than pure water; a basic substance shows greater quantities of ions [OH\u2013] than pure water. The concentrations \nof substances are expressed in moles per litre. In pure water, the ion concentration [H+] and [OH\u2013] is 1.0 x 10\u20137 M, it is thus considered a neutral substance. In reality, it is a weak electrolyte that is dissociated \nfollowing the following equation:H\n2O  '  [H+][OH\u2013] \nIn all aqueous solutions there is a balance expressed as:   \n[H+][OH\u2013] = K \n     H2O\nIf the solution is diluted, the concentration of the non-dissociated water can be considered constant:\n[H+][OH\u2013] = [H2O]K = Ka\nThe new constant Ka is called a constant of dissociation or ionic product of water and its value is 1.0x10\u201314 at 25 \u00b0C. [H+][OH\u2013] = 1.0 x 10-14\nX x X = 1.0 x 10-14\nX2 = 1.0 x 10-14\nX = 1.0 x 10-7\nIn pure water the concentrations of H+ and OH\u2013 are 1.0 x 10\u20137 M, a very low concentration, given that the molar concentration of water is 55.4 mol\/litre.

It must be taken into account that the weight is the force which the gravitational fi  eld exercises on a body\u2019s mass, this force being the product of the mass \nby the local acceleration of gravity [F = m x g]. The term local is used to emphasize that this acceleration depends on factors such as the geographical latitude, altitude and the Earth\u2019s density where the measurement is taken. This force is measured in Newtons.

In the laboratory, the balance is used \nfor weighing as part of quality control activities (on devices like pipettes), in the preparation of mixtures of components in predefined proportions and in the determination of specifi  c densities or weights. OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThere are diff  erences in design, principles and criteria of \nmetrology amongst balances. At present, there are two large groups of balances: mechanical and electronic balances. Mechanical balances \nThe following are some of the more common ones: 1. Spring balance. Its function is based on a mechanical \nproperty of springs as the force exercised on a spring is proportional to the spring\u2019s elasticity constant [k], multiplied by its elongation [x] [F = -kx]. The greater the mass [m] placed on the balance\u2019s plate, the greater the elongation will be, given that the elongation is proportional to the mass and the spring\u2019s constant. The calibration of a spring balance depends on the force of gravity acting on the object weighed. This type of balance is used when great precision is not necessary. 2. Sliding weight balance. This type of balance is \nequipped with two known weights which can be moved on setting scales (one macro, the other micro). Upon placing a substance of unknown mass on the tray, its weight is determined by moving the weight on both setting scales until the equilibrium position is reached. At this point, the weight is obtained by adding both quantities indicated by the sliding masses\u2019 position on the scale. 3. Analytical balance. This balance functions by comparing \nknown weight masses with that of a substance of unknown weight. It is composed of a base on a bar or symmetrical lever, maintained by a blade-like support on a central point called a fulcrum. At its ends, there are stirrups, also supported with blades which allow these to oscillate smoothly. From there, two plates are suspended. Certifi  ed weights are placed on one \nof the plates and unknown weights on the other. The balance has a securing system or lock, which allows the main lever to remain stable when not in use or when it is necessary to modify the counter-weights. The balance is inside an external box which protects it from interferences, such as air currents. Analytical balances can weigh ten thousandths of a gram (0.0001 g) or 100 thousandths of a gram (0.00001 g). This type of balance generally has a capacity of up to 200 grams.

Analytical balance  MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n23It is necessary to have a set of certifi  ed masses. The set is \ngenerally composed of the following pieces:\n4. Upper plate balance (Top loading or parallel guidance \nbalance). This type of balance has a loading plate located \non its upper part, supported by a column maintained in a vertical position by two pairs of guides with fl  exible \nconnections. The eff  ect of the force produced by the \nmass is transmitted from a point on the vertical column directly or by some mechanical means to the loading cell. The requirement with this type of mechanism is that parallel guides must be maintained with exactitude of up to \u00b1 1  \u00b5m. Deviations in parallelism cause an error known \nas lateral load (when the mass being weighed shows diff erences if the reading is taken at the centre of the \nplate or on one of its sides). The diagram shown below explains the operation principle some manufacturers have introduced in electronic balances.","MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n55\n5.

It must be taken into account that the weight is the force which the gravitational fi  eld exercises on a body\u2019s mass, this force being the product of the mass \nby the local acceleration of gravity [F = m x g]. The term local is used to emphasize that this acceleration depends on factors such as the geographical latitude, altitude and the Earth\u2019s density where the measurement is taken. This force is measured in Newtons.

In the laboratory, the balance is used \nfor weighing as part of quality control activities (on devices like pipettes), in the preparation of mixtures of components in predefined proportions and in the determination of specifi  c densities or weights. OPERATION PRINCIPLES\nThere are diff  erences in design, principles and criteria of \nmetrology amongst balances. At present, there are two large groups of balances: mechanical and electronic balances. Mechanical balances \nThe following are some of the more common ones: 1. Spring balance. Its function is based on a mechanical \nproperty of springs as the force exercised on a spring is proportional to the spring\u2019s elasticity constant [k], multiplied by its elongation [x] [F = -kx]. The greater the mass [m] placed on the balance\u2019s plate, the greater the elongation will be, given that the elongation is proportional to the mass and the spring\u2019s constant. The calibration of a spring balance depends on the force of gravity acting on the object weighed. This type of balance is used when great precision is not necessary. 2. Sliding weight balance. This type of balance is \nequipped with two known weights which can be moved on setting scales (one macro, the other micro). Upon placing a substance of unknown mass on the tray, its weight is determined by moving the weight on both setting scales until the equilibrium position is reached. At this point, the weight is obtained by adding both quantities indicated by the sliding masses\u2019 position on the scale. 3. Analytical balance. This balance functions by comparing \nknown weight masses with that of a substance of unknown weight. It is composed of a base on a bar or symmetrical lever, maintained by a blade-like support on a central point called a fulcrum. At its ends, there are stirrups, also supported with blades which allow these to oscillate smoothly. From there, two plates are suspended. Certifi  ed weights are placed on one \nof the plates and unknown weights on the other. The balance has a securing system or lock, which allows the main lever to remain stable when not in use or when it is necessary to modify the counter-weights. The balance is inside an external box which protects it from interferences, such as air currents. Analytical balances can weigh ten thousandths of a gram (0.0001 g) or 100 thousandths of a gram (0.00001 g). This type of balance generally has a capacity of up to 200 grams.

Analytical balance  MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n23It is necessary to have a set of certifi  ed masses. The set is \ngenerally composed of the following pieces:\n4. Upper plate balance (Top loading or parallel guidance \nbalance). This type of balance has a loading plate located \non its upper part, supported by a column maintained in a vertical position by two pairs of guides with fl  exible \nconnections. The eff  ect of the force produced by the \nmass is transmitted from a point on the vertical column directly or by some mechanical means to the loading cell. The requirement with this type of mechanism is that parallel guides must be maintained with exactitude of up to \u00b1 1  \u00b5m. Deviations in parallelism cause an error known \nas lateral load (when the mass being weighed shows diff erences if the reading is taken at the centre of the \nplate or on one of its sides). The diagram shown below explains the operation principle some manufacturers have introduced in electronic balances.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>MAINTENANCE MANUAL FOR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT\n55\n5.
